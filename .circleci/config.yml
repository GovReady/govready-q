            [NIST SP 800-53 Rev 4 -- CM-2] Baseline packages are installed using pip, which reads the
            requirements.txt file for a list of packages to install. Additionally, the script
            fetch-vendor-resources.sh lists other external software packages needed by the program.
            In both cases, package versions are pinned using version numbers and package hashes.
