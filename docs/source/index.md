GovReady-Q Documentation
========================

.. NOTE::
   This documentation set is part of GovReady v0.9.0. In places, it may still refer to v0.8.6 software features rather than v0.9.0 features. Thank you for your patience while we update the documentation to apply to the v0.9.0 software. *Pull requests are very welcome!*

The GovReady-Q Compliance Server is an open source GRC platform for highly automated, user-friendly, self-service compliance assessments and documentation. It's perfect for DevSecOps.

GovReady-Q solves the painful compliance bottleneck of needing months to authorize applications that deploy and redeploy in minutes.

The code is open source, and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/GovReady/govready-q).

.. ATTENTION::
   GovReady-Q is in Beta. Suggested for DevSecOps early adopters needing Compliance-as-Code.
