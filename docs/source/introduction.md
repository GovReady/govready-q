# About GovReady-Q

## Why GovReady-Q?

<!-- Compliance is a huge value-add for organizations because it scales trust. "Certified" means tested and approved. When pace and scale of an activity reaches a certain critical point, increases, quality assurance by individuals must be replaced with compliance regimes on risk/reward themselves risk assessment with compliance regimes... 

For too many organizations, compliance has become the main bottleneck---the primary constraint---on the pace of innovation. Their staff experiences assessments, documentation, and audits as exasperating, invisible work holding back their ability to deliver new value.
-->

Everything about developing and deploying software is accelerating...except for compliance. Why? Because:

* maintaining written documentation is too slow,
* pondering how jargon-laden control guidance applies is too hard,
* there's little reuse, and no compliance documentation supply chain.

To stop needing months to authorize systems that deploy in minutes, assessments and authorizations need to be assembled from vetted, pre-fabricated components sourced from the same software supply chain with which we assemble applications.

## How GovReady-Q Accelerates Compliance

GovReady accelerates compliance through component-centric guidance, pre-written documentation, and collaboration.

**When you use or install GovReady-Q, you gain access to a marketplace of small, self-service compliance apps written by peers and vendors that map system components to security controls and guide you step-by-step through assessments and documentation.**

As you and your teammates collaboratively answer questions, the compliance apps work with GovReady-Q to store your data in a relational database and automagically generate and maintain your compliance artifacts for auditors.

GovReady-Q's contribution to Compliance-as-Code is the data abstractions for shareable, reusable, and customizable packages---*Compliance Apps*---to map the relationship between a system component and a set of controls. The approach is innovative, yet familiar. Compliance Apps:

* enable a hub/marketplace for community contributions;
* extend inherited controls model to each system component;
* enable modern, user-friendly experiences;
* support agile, iterative workflows.

.. ATTENTION::
   GovReady-Q software is "Beta" software best suited for early adopters needing faster compliance for DevSecOps.

<!-- GovReady-Q accelerates compliance by tackling the data management challenges of compliance. GovReady-Q does not scan servers or end-points. (Lots of tools do that.) Instead, GovReady-Q makes it easy to trace the relationship between system components and security control descriptions and evidence. 

GovReady-Q is open source GRC (Governance Risk & Compliance) platform for self-service preparation of compliance artifacts. It's ultra-friendly to use and ultra-compatible with Agile/DevOps Software Development Life Cycle.

## GovReady-Q Philosophy

**Compliance is not security. Compliance scales security.**

Compliance is a technique humans have developed for enabling trust in systems that are too large and complex for individuals to assess trustworthiness. Compliance scales participation, attestation and verification of recommended practices.

* We love security and innovation and believe they enable each other.
* We believe security and compliance are standard, not premium add-ons.
* We view compliance as a by-product of a well-instrumented process.
* We value ease-of-use to increase adoption.
* We value automation to increase consistency.
* We see virtualization and DevOps enabling massive gains in security and compliance.
