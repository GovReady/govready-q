Applying Custom Organization Branding
=====================================

The look and feel of GovReady-Q can be customized a bit by overriding
the Django templates that are used to construct the site’s pages and by
serving additional static assets.

Custom branding can contain static assets (such as a logo image) and
HTML template overrides. Branding is packaged into a directory with a
particular directory layout and some Python boilerplate code that allows
GovReady-Q to find the branding files. The directory is placed inside
the main GovReady-Q directory, and an application setting is used to
activate it.

Before setting out to create custom branding, make sure you have
GovReady-Q `set up for development on your
workstation <deploy_local_dev.html>`__. You’ll need a working setup of
GovReady-Q to create the branding directory and to test your changes.

Creating the branding directory
-------------------------------

Custom branding is packaged inside what Django confusingly calls an
`application <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/applications/>`__,
but it is just a packaged sub-component of a website. To create a new
branding package directory, change to the directory where you have
GovReady-Q set up. Then run:

.. code:: sh

   python3 manage.py startapp sample_branding

This command creates a new directory called ``sample_branding`` with
Python boilerplate code to make it a valid Django “application.”

Make directories for storing the custom static assets and templates:

.. code:: sh

   mkdir sample_branding/static
   mkdir sample_branding/templates

Activate the branding package
-----------------------------

Next, let your development installation of GovReady-Q know that you want
to use the custom branding package. In your ``local/environment.json``
file, add a setting named ``branding`` and set it to the name of the
custom branding package directory.

.. code:: sh

     "branding": "sample_branding",

See `Environment Settings <Environment.html>`__ for more information
about the ``local/environment.json`` file. Note that for the file to be
valid JSON the last setting cannot have a trailing comma.

Overriding templates
--------------------

Any of the templates that make up GovReady-Q’s frontend can be
overridden. The full list of templates can be browsed in GovReady-Q’s
GitHub repository at

https://github.com/GovReady/govready-q/tree/master/templates

Start by trying to override the ``navbar.html`` template, which is
inserted at the top of every page. Use your favorite text editor to
create a file at ``sample_branding/templates/navbar.html``. Copy the
content of GovReady-Q’s stock ``navbar.html`` from
https://github.com/GovReady/govready-q/blob/master/templates/navbar.html
into it. (GitHub’s “Raw” button is handy for getting a clean version to
save or copy/paste.)

At the bottom of the file, add some custom HTML, such as:

.. code:: html

   <div>
     <b>Welcome to my organization&rsquo;s custom site!</b>
   </div>

Start GovReady-Q on your workstation (see the `development
docs <deploy_local_dev.html>`__) and visit a page. You should see your
new content below the navbar at the top of every page.

Adding custom CSS
-----------------

You can also add a custom CSS stylesheet to your branded GovReady-Q by
taking the following steps:

a) Add the CSS file as a static asset.
b) Insert a ``<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">`` tag into the
   ``<head>`` section of each page’s HTML by overriding the
   ``head.html`` template.

To create the static asset, make a new file named
``sample_branding/static/custom.css``. Let’s say you want to make the
background color of each page red. The file should contain:

.. code:: css

   body {
       background: red !important;
   }

Then override the ``head.html`` template. GovReady-Q’s base for
``head.html`` is empty — its purpose is only to allow you to add to the
``<head>`` element. So create a new file at
``sample_branding/templates/head.html`` and put in it:

.. code:: jinja

   {% load static %}
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static "custom.css" %}">

See the `Django documentation for static
files <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/static-files/>`__ for
more information about the ``static`` template tag.

Open any page in your locally running GovReady-Q and you should see that
the background color of every page has changed.

Keeping your templates up to date
---------------------------------

With each new released version of GovReady-Q, there is the possibility
that the stock templates have changed. Some changes may require you to
re-engineer your template overrides to preserve functionality.

Creating a custom Docker image
------------------------------

If your organization is deploying GovReady-Q using Docker, you will need
to embed your custom branding package within a Docker image. You have
two options:

1. Modify GovReady-Q’s stock Dockerfile, i.e. the one in GovReady-Q’s
   source code, to add and activate your branding package and then
   *build your own GovReady-Q Docker image* from the GovReady-Q source
   files that you cloned from GitHub.
2. Make your own Dockerfile that *uses a released GovReady-Q image as
   its parent image* and adds to it just the steps needed to add and
   activate your branding package.

Creating your own Dockerfile that uses a released GovReady-Q image as its parent image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend method 2. To create your own Dockerfile that uses a
released GovReady-Q image as its parent image, create a new
``Dockerfile`` in your branding package directory, e.g. a new file named
``Dockerfile`` in the ``sample_branding`` directory you created earlier.

Then choose which parent image you will use from the available
`GovReady-Q tags <https://hub.docker.com/r/govready/govready-q/tags>`__.
Each tag corresponds to a release version. Your Dockerfile begins with a
``FROM`` line that combines ``govready/govready-q:`` with the tag name
you choose. In this example we use the ``latest`` tag which is an alias
for the most recent version of GovReady-Q:

.. code:: dockerfile

   FROM govready/govready-q:latest

The subsequent commands in your Dockerfile configures the container,
picking up where the parent image’s Dockerfile leaves off. For more
information about the parent image, refer to `GovReady-Q’s Dockerfile on
GitHub <https://github.com/GovReady/govready-q/blob/master/Dockerfile>`__.

Your Dockerfile’s next step is to add your branding package into the
image in a directory named ``branding``:

.. code:: dockerfile

   RUN mkdir branding
   COPY . branding

Finally, you’ll need some commands to adjust permissions, to activate
the branding package when GovReady-Q starts, and to prepare the static
assets to be served. The complete Dockerfile should look like this:

.. code:: dockerfile

   # Build an image on top of the stock GovReady-Q image.
   FROM govready/govready-q:latest

   # The parent Dockerfile ends with 'USER application' to run the
   # container as a non-privileged user. But we need to go back to
   # root to add additional files and then switch back to the non-
   # root user at the end.
   USER root

   # Copy our public app files into place.
   RUN mkdir branding
   COPY . branding

   # Activate the branding package. The environment variable is read
   # by dockerfile_exec.sh in the GovReady-Q parent image. And modifying
   # /tmp/environment.json is necessary at this step so that collectstatic
   # picks it up below.
   ENV BRANDING branding
   RUN sed -i "s/}/,\"branding\": \"branding\" }/" /tmp/environment.json

   # Flatten static files. The base image did it once, but we may have
   # added new static files so we must do it again.
   RUN python3.6 manage.py collectstatic --noinput

   # Run the container's process zero as this user --- see above.
   USER application

   # Check that everything looks good.
   RUN python3.6 manage.py check

Finally you can build and test your custom image.

Building your docker image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you were in the GovReady-Q sources directory, move into your branding
package directory:

.. code:: bash

   cd sample_branding

Then fetch the parent image and build your image:

.. code:: bash

   docker image pull govready/govready-q:latest
   docker image build --tag myorg/govready-q-branded:latest .

(Substitute the right tag depending on the tag you chose for the
``FROM`` line in your Dockerfile.)

Test that your image works by launching a new container based on your
image:

.. code:: bash

   docker container run --rm -it -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 myorg/govready-q-branded:latest

Once GovReady-Q is running in the container, visit it at
``http://localhost:8000``. Use CTRL+C in the console to terminate and
destroy the test container running your image.

Docker <deploy_docker.html>`__.
