Deploying GovReady-Q for Development
====================================

This page provides additional tips for installing and run GovReady-Q in
a mode suitable for making and testing changes to the software (i.e., in
a Dev environment).

Quickstart
----------

For local development, there is a quickstart script available to speed
up environment setup. After installing `system
requirements <https://govready-q.readthedocs.io/en/latest/requirements.html#system-requirements>`__
through your package manager, run the following four commands in order
to set up GovReady-Q in a new directory:

::

   git clone https://github.com/govready/govready-q
   cd govready-q
   virtualenv -p python3 env
   ./quickstart.sh

This will set up a ``local/environment.json`` file suitable for a dev
environment; set up local dependencies; and run the assorted initial
manage.py commands (``migrate``, ``load_modules``, ``first_run``, etc.).
Additionally, it can run common post-installation steps, based on user
input.

The ``quickstart.sh`` script is set up to take user input, and is
expected to be run interactively.

Creating local/environment.json file
------------------------------------

When you first run GovReady-Q with ``python manage.py runserver``,
you’ll be prompted to copy some JSON data into a file at
``local/environment.json`` like this:

::

   {
     "debug": true,
     "host": "localhost:8000",
     "https": false,
     "secret-key": "...something here..."
   }

This file is important for persisting login sessions, and you can
provide other Q settings in this file.

Invitations on local systems
----------------------------

You will probably want to try the invite feature at some point. The
debug server is configured to dump all outbound emails to the console.
So if you “invite” others to join you within the application, you’ll
need to go to the console to get the invitation acceptance link.

Updating the source code
------------------------

To update the source code from this repository you can ``git pull``. You
then may need to re-run some of the setup commands:

::

   # if you set up virtualenv
   git pull
   source env/bin/activate
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ./fetch-vendor-resources.sh
   python3 manage.py migrate
   python3 manage.py load_modules

   # if you did NOT set up virtualenv
   git pull
   pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
   ./fetch-vendor-resources.sh
   python3 manage.py migrate
   python3 manage.py load_modules
