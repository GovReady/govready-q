# Version 0.9.0

Release 0.9.0 (coming July 2019) is a minor release improving
the user experience and performance.

* Faster loading and launching of Assessments/questionnaires
* Simplified install with no subdomains to worry about
* Replaces subdomain multi-tenancy with simplified "Groups" model
* Improved authoring screens
* Helpful new start page

Release 0.9.0 removes multi-tenancy and serves all pages from the on the same domain. In earlier versions, requests to GovReady-Q came in on subdomains and the subdomain determined which Organization in the database the request would be associated with and individuals had to re-login across subdomains. Multi-tenancy increased install complexity and we were not seeing use of the multi-tenancy feature. Deployment is now simpler.

This release's compliance apps catalog now reads from the database rather than going to remote repositories The app catalog cache is removed since the page loads much faster. Release 0.9.0 begins to replace the "compliance app" terminology with the plain language "projects" and "assessment" terminology in the end user pages.

This release also introduces a "Group" feature to organize and manage related projects.

For a complete list of changes see the [0.9.0.rc branch CHANGELOG](https://github.com/GovReady/govready-q/blob/0.9.0.rc/CHANGELOG.md).

Release 0.9.0 progress can be found on the `0.9.0.rc-xxx` branches. For the convenience of this documentation and building Docker containers, the branch `0.9.0.rc` has also been created.

## Release Date

The target release date 0.9.0 is July 2019.

## Upgrading to 0.9.0 from 0.8.x

**Backup your database before upgrading to 0.9.0. Release 0.9.0 performs database changes that makes rolling back difficult.**

If you are installing from source code:
1. Pull and use the [0.9.0-rc branch](https://github.com/GovReady/govready-q/tree/0.9.0.rc).
2. Tell Django to run the database migrations (e.g., `python manage.py migrate`).
3. We recommend updating to your `local/environment.json` file to address release 0.9.0's removal of the need to manage subdomain-based multi-tenancy.

If you are installing using Docker:
1. Make sure you pull the [0.9.0-rc container](https://cloud.docker.com/u/govready/repository/docker/govready/govready-q-0.9.0.rc).
2. If you are using environment variables to connect the Docker deployment to a persistent database, GovReady-Q will automatically run the database migrations on start up.
3. Release 0.9.0 will ignore the subdomain-related environment variables that are no longer needed. We recommend updating your environment variables to remove them.

## Installing 0.9.0

Release 0.9.0 simplifies the installation of GovReady-Q by removing the need to manage subdomain-based multi-tenancy.

The installation of assessments (aka "Compliance Apps") requires an extra step in 0.9.0 but greatly improves user experience.

        GovReady-Q calls requires Python 3.6 or higher to run and several Unix packages to provide full functionality. Install the Homebrew package manager (https://brew.sh) to easily install Unix packages on macOS. Homebrew will install all packages in your userspace and not change native macOS Python or other libraries.

## Adding and Managing AppSources in 0.9.0

Release 0.9.0 reads the compliance apps catalog from the database rather than going to remote repositories and rescanning the local file system each time. The app catalog cache is removed since the page loads much faster.

Release 0.9.0 loads the YAML files into the database when the App Source is first defined. See [App Sources](AppSources.html) for more information about how to configure your instance of GovReady-Q to load apps from local filesystem directories, git repositories (including on-prem git repositories), or GitHub.

The AppSource admin now lists all of the apps provided by the source and has links to import new app versions into the database and to see the app versions already in the database by version number. When the App Source is defined, additional options appear on the database App Source admin page to selectively add individual projects and assessments from the App Source repository to the be published on GovReady-Q. Any time the individual admin page for an App Source is viewed, the App Source is rescanned and new versions of the apps are displayed to be selectively added to be available to users on GovReady-Q.

![screenshot of App Sources list of apps](assets/appsource_apps.png)

When starting a compliance app (i.e. creating a new project), we no longer have to import the app from the remote repository --- instead, we create a new Project and set its root_task to point to a Module in an AppVersion already in the database.

App loading is refactored in a few places. The routines for getting app catalog information from the remote app data are removed since now we only need it for apps already stored in the database.

The AppSource admin's approved app lists form is removed since adding apps into the database is now an administrative function and the database column for it is dropped.

AppVersion now has a boolean field for whether the instance should be included in the compliance apps catalog for users to start new projects with that app.
