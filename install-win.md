# Testing GovReady-Q Install Script

## System Requirements

* A Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Git installed.
* Python 3.6 or higher will be required.
  * On Macs, you should already have Python 3 and Git installed.
  * On Windows, you may need to install a [Windows version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), and [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) or a [Windows version of Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).  Or, you can use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
* Access to a command line, to run Python and Git commands.
* 300-500 MB of free disk space to install GovReady-Q. The installed files will be in the GovReady-Q directory, and you may delete that directory after the test.
* Internet access or alternative resources:
  * Access to repositories with appropriate operating systems packages for OS dependencies.
  * Access to https://github.com/GovReady/govready-q, https://govready.com/govready-q/download, or another repository with GovReady-Q source code
  * Access to https://pypi.org/simple or local mirror of Pypi to install Python dependencies. 
* On macOS, installation of some additional dependencies.

# for pandoc, enable PowerTools repository
dnf install dnf-plugins-core
dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools
dnf install pandoc
```

## Before You Install - macOS

Some additional dependencies are required for macOS.

Setup instructions (may need to be cleaned up and/or fleshed out.)

Do this shell command.

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

(See [How to fix the xcrun invalid active developer path error in macOS](https://flaviocopes.com/fix-xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-path/) for more complete instructions.)

If you get an error that command line tools are already installed, just proceed.

Next, install Homebrew, if it is not already installed.  This is one way to get started.

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

(For more details, see [Installation â€” Homebrew Documentation](https://brew.sh/).)

After Homebrew is installed, do this shell command.

```shell
brew install libmagic
```

If you get a warning that libmagic is already installed, just proceed.

After Homebrew is installed, do this shell command.

```shell
brew install postgresql
```

If you get a warning that postgresql is already installed, just proceed.

[Note, this is needed to resolve this dependency: "Error: pg_config executable not found. pg_config is required to build psycopg2 from source." We should just move this dependency out to a pg_requirements file.]

## Install Instructions

Start your command line shell.

Go to a directory that you can download GovReady-Q into.  If you wish, you can create a new directory, and change directory into it.

### 1. Clone GovReady-Q

Do these shell commands.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GovReady/govready-q.git
cd govready-q

### 2. Create and Activate Python Virtual Environmemt

On **Windows**, do these shell commands.

```shell
py -m venv venv
venv\scripts\activate.bat
```

On **Linux and Mac**, do these shell commands.

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should not see any output.  Your prompt may or may not change to include "venv".

### 3. Run Installer

Do this shell command for to see all install options.

```shell
python3 install.py -h
```

The script will print command options.

```shell
>>>>>>>>>> Welcome to the GovReady-Q Installer <<<<<<<<<

usage: install.py [-h] [--non-interactive] [--timeout TIMEOUT] [--user]
                  [--verbose]

Quickly set up a new GovReady-Q instance from a freshly-cloned repository.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --non-interactive, -n
                        run without terminal interaction
  --timeout TIMEOUT, -t TIMEOUT
