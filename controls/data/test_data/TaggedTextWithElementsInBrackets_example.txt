[AC-2]


This control  may be inherited as HYBRID from [CloudOps].


The organization:

(a) Identifies and selects the following types of information system accounts to support organizational missions/business functions: Individual (Human and Non-Human), Shared, System;

Neither our cloud platform, nor our CloudOps hosts in AWS support shared (or group) accounts. For each services hosted on CloudOps. The CloudOps hosts in AWS are only accessible by individual accounts with “need to know” ACLs  applied; users do not get access until demonstrating they need access and can explain how log access is needed. System accounts for cloud platform services (the users that applications run as) are restricted to their respective hosts, and do not permit login; users/processes are not permitted to login as applications.

(b)  The leads of the [Larry Murry Operation (LMO) Team ]acts are the System account managers. They create [CloudOps] system access to the [LMO team] members. LMO team leads do NOT grant project members accounts with access production or PRD hosts.  A DOS project may be granted a system access to a disposable development host on request. The development hosts are shared by the project developers, each must individually authenticate to sign in as managed by the LMO team leads.

(c) Establishes conditions for group and role membership;
The LMO team establishes groups and rules (roles) and along with the business owner determines who can be granted access to the security groups associated with CloudOps.  Additionally the LMO team establishes naming conventions for security groups and roles and grants access to the groups based on need-to-know and job function.  The principals of Separation of Duties and least privilege are taken into account when access is granted.  Once naming conventions are defined and implemented the LMO team performs the function of defining new application roles and security groups in accordance with requests made they the application owners and approved implementation plans, provided by development teams.  

Disposable development hosts live no longer than 10 days. User will get access to replacement hosts without need to request additional access, but the new host will be a new pristine development environment.

(d)  Group and User roles include:  [Group Owner], [Developer], [Operator], [Auditor], [Reporter], [Admin] (specific to LMO team members only.)

(e) The LMO Team is working on [user access request (UAR) form] for project teams to request access to CloudOps resources. Each request must be approved by the project lead, or project/program manager.

The [UAR process] is as follows:
• A government supervisor needs to create a ticket in [Uwallia tool] with [XCI] (DOS.Technology.Service.Desk@DOS.GOV) for background investigation verification. 
• Once the [Uwallia] ticket is resolved, the Supervisor needs to fill up Part III of this form with the Uwallia ticket #, completion date, and sign the form. 
• Once filled up, this PDF form needs to be password protected. Forward the completed form (one user per form only) to the Approval Authority. Send the password in a separate email. Once finally approved, the form needs to be forwarded to the LMO team (email@email.gov) with the same password protection method.

(f)  The [CloudOps User Access Request (UAR) form] for users to request access to CloudOps resources; the form  allow users to request new account, modifying existing account, or deleting accounts when no longer needed.

(g) Monitors the use of, information system accounts;
here are two types of accounts in CloudOps.  System accounts and user accounts.  System accounts are used by CloudOps to support the underlying platforms and system software such as VMs., [Jenkins] and [Sonatype], these accounts are also often called non-human accounts. User accounts are used by individuals or people to log onto an application of platform.  The Kibana audit dashboards show the accounts both system and user logged into hosts and commands that were run. The services report which user performed an operation in their logs. User accounts for services are very limited, they can only see and act on information in their domain. The [CloudOps ISSO] is responsible for reviewing the reports generated by [Kibana].  

Users signing onto applications are not monitored by the CloudOps ISSO.  The [application ISSO] is responsible for monitoring at the application level.  

The CloudOps team has developed a [CloudOps User Access Request (UAR) form]. The form must be approved by the supervisor (project lead, or project/program manager) of the requester; the request must include detailed justification why the account is needed; the form will also required other information such as HashID and others parameters required for verification of background checks.

The UAR process is as follows:
• A government supervisor needs to create a ticket in Uwallia tool with XCI (DOS.Technology.Service.Desk@DOS.GOV) for background investigation verification. 
• Once the Uwallia ticket is resolved, the Supervisor needs to fill up Part III of this form with the Uwallia ticket#, completion date, and sign the form. 
• Once filled up, this PDF form needs to be password protected. Forward the completed form (one user per form only) to the Approval Authority. Send the password in a separate email. Once finally approved, the form needs to be forwarded to the LMO team (email@email.gov) with the same password protection method.


The ISSO reviews this control at least annually or whenever there is a significant change.

Receiver Responsibility:

The receiving application ensures this control implementation fully satisfies the control requirements and accurately describes the control implementation for the receiver. Additionally receiving applications   document any variance.

Receiving applications will utilize the CloudOps User Access Request (UAR) form to request access to CloudOps.  The receiving application is also responsible for documenting all application specific processes and procedures for requesting access to the receiving application.

Applications receiving Tier 3 Support are responsible for all authentication and access permissions for the platform being deployed on the CloudOps IaaS.  LMO provides no support other than standing up the EC2 Instance.

For full details on Tier I, II, and III support provided by LMO team, please consult the http://docs.DOS.gov, specifically under section Platforms>Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)>Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).


[AU-2]

This control may be inherited as HYBRID from CloudOps.

The [CloudOps ISSO] has access to the audit logs in [Kibana] however responses are based on artifacts provided by the [LMO team].  References to CloudOps's implementation of the Kibana analytics and visualization tool can be found here: http://docs.DOS.gov/tools/kibana.html?highlight=elasticsearch.

a) It has been determined that the information system is capable of auditing the following events: Successful and unsuccessful account logon events, account management events, object access, policy change, privilege functions, process tracking, and system events. 

(b) The [LMO Team] and the [ISSO] Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable events;

(c) CloudOps is in the process of documenting the support in the [CloudOps Audit Review Standard Operating Procedures] which provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and

(d) Determines that the following events are to be audited within the information system: organization-defined subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a to be audited continually for each identified event.  This is also a document being defined and will be reviewed by the ISSO and LMO Team.

The set of CloudOps auditable events implemented in Kibana, apply to all of CloudOps resources, including [Tier I and II EC2 instances]. [Tier III EC2 instances] will not have centralized audit logs implemented and will be the responsibility of the application team to audit Tier III usage.

For full details on [Tier I, II, and III EC2 instances] support provided by LMO team, please consult the http://docs.DOS.gov, specifically under section Platforms>Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)>Elastic Compute Cloud ([EC2]).

The ISSO reviews this control at least annually or whenever there is a significant change. 

Receiver Responsibility:

The receiving application ensures this control implementation fully satisfies the control requirements and accurately describes the control implementation for the receiver. Additionally receiving applications   document any variance.

It is the responsibility of the application ISSO or development teams to work with the LMO team to ensure application audit logs are defined correctly and sent to Kibana for application ISSO review. The receiving application is responsible for writing application specific audit log review processes and procedures.

The set of CloudOps auditable events implemented in [Kibana], apply to all of CloudOps resources, including Tier I and II EC2 instances. Tier III EC2 instances will not have centralized audit logs implemented and will be the responsibility of the application team to audit Tier III usage.
