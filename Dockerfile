# Configure supervisord.
# a) Wipe out /var/{run,log} because when these directories are mounted with
#    tmpfs they will be empty, so start them empty so the two setups match.
# b) Make /var/{run,log} world-writable because when we start the container with
#    the non-root user it will need permission to write there.
# c) Move the supervisor log from /var/log/supervisor and the child process logs
#    from /tmp to /var/log to make them all easily accessible if /var/log is mounted
#    to a volume, and similarly the run socket from /var/run/supervisor.
#    Otherwise we have to mess with file permissions so the inner directories are
#    writable, and I couldn't get that to work. Even if the directories had chmod 777
#    the non-root user could not create files inside them.
