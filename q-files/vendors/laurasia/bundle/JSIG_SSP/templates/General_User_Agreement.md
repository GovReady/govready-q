<b>By signing this document, you consent to the following conditions:</b>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. Government routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this information system for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, communications security (COMSEC) monitoring, network operations and defense, personal misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

<li>At any time, the U.S. Government may inspect and seize data stored on this information system.

<li>Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any U.S. Government-authorized purpose.

<li>This information system includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect U.S. Government interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

<li>Notwithstanding the above, using an information system does not constitute consent to personnel misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications or data (including work product) that are related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Under these circumstances, such communications and work product are private and confidential, as further explained below:

<ul>
<li>Nothing in this User Agreement shall be interpreted to limit the user's consent to, or in any other way restrict or affect, any U.S. Government actions for purposes of network administration, operation, protection, or defense, or for communications security. This includes all communications and data on an information system, regardless of any applicable privilege or confidentiality.

<li>The user consents to interception/capture and seizure of ALL communications and data for any authorized purpose (including personal misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigation). However, consent to interception/capture or seizure of communications and data is not consent to the use of privileged communications or data for personnel misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigation against any party and does not negate any applicable privilege or confidentiality that otherwise applies.

<li>Whether any particular communication or data qualifies for the protection of a privilege, or is covered by a duty of confidentiality, is determined in accordance with established legal standards and DoD policy. Users are strongly encouraged to seek personal legal counsel on such matters prior to using an information system if the user intends to rely on the protections of a privilege or confidentiality.

<li>Users should take reasonable steps to identify such communications or data that the user asserts are protected by any such privilege or confidentiality. However, the user's identification or assertion of a privilege or confidentiality is not sufficient to create such protection where none exists under established legal standards and DoD policy.

<li>A user's failure to take reasonable steps to identify such communications or data as privileged or confidential does not waive the privilege or confidentiality if such protections otherwise exist under established legal standards and DoD policy. However, in such cases the U.S. Government is authorized to take reasonable actions to identify such communication or data as being subject to a privilege or confidentiality, and such actions do not negate any applicable privilege or confidentiality.

<li>These conditions preserve the confidentiality of the communication or data, and the legal protections regarding the use and disclosure of privileged information, and thus such communications and data are private and confidential. Further, the U.S. Government shall take all reasonable measures to protect the content of captured/seized privileged communications and data to ensure they are appropriately protected.
</ul>

<li>In cases when the user has consented to content searching or monitoring of communications or data for personnel misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigative searching, (i.e., for all communications and data other than privileged communications or data that are related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants), the U.S. Government may, solely at its discretion and in accordance with DoD policy, elect to apply a privilege or other restriction on the U.S. Government's otherwise-authorized use or disclosure of such information.
</ul>

<span></span>
All of the above conditions apply regardless of whether the access or use of an information system includes the display of a Notice and Consent Banner ("banner"). When a banner is used, the banner functions to remind the user of the conditions that are set forth in this User Agreement, regardless of whether the banner describes these conditions in full detail or provides a summary of such conditions, and regardless of whether the banner expressly references this User Agreement.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal;text-autospace:
none'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>MINIMUM SECURITY RULES</span></b></p>

<span></span>

<ol>
  <li>I understand that I have the necessary clearance, access, and requirement for access to the information system and/or application(s) identified below the signature block.  I will not introduce or process data on the IS which I have not been specifically authorized to handle. I will not introduce or process data that the IS is not specifically authorized to process.

  <li>I will protect all authenticators (e.g., passwords, smart card personal identification numbers (PIN)/passwords, PKI private certificates) from disclosure to entities other than the user, system authentication components, and the authorized authenticator distribution entities. Single factor authenticators shall be protected commensurate with the information sensitivity accessible by the associated entity. Additionally, I will use separate and unique passwords for all accounts across
different domains of classification and report any compromise or suspected compromise of an authenticator to the appropriate ISSO.

  <li>I understand that I am the only authorized user of my assigned account and I am responsible for any and all activity that occurs while logged into the system under my assigned User ID. I will use this assigned account and the information systems (computers, systems, applications, and networks) only for authorized purposes. I will not attempt to “hack” the network or any connected information systems, or gain access to data to which I do not have authorization.
  
  <li>I will not connect any personal IT equipment (e.g. PEDs and PDAs, personal computers, digitally enabled devices, or USB devices and 'toys') to my U.S. Government system or network without prior written approval of the system/network Authorizing Official.
  
  <li>I will not modify or turn off the operating system password protected screen saver. I will remove my CAC or smartcard from the system during periods of temporary non-use when departing the immediate area and at the end of the duty day.

  <li>I understand my responsibility to appropriately protect and label all output generated under my account (i.e., emails, printed materials, and removable media devices).

  <li>I will not download, install or use any personally-owned, commercial off-the shelf or public domain hardware, software, shareware, freeware, file-sharing software (including MP3 music and video files), peer-to peer software, games or devices on a U.S. Government system. I will use only authorized hardware and software.

  <li>I will not enter information that is proprietary, contractor-excluded, or otherwise needs special protection or handling, unless approved in writing by my unit/directorate/activity ISSM/ISSO. I will ensure that all approved desktop and mobile computing devices I possess (laptop, PDA, Blackberry, etc.) have an approved data-at-rest solution (e.g., encryption) installed, configured and in use.

  <li>I will not access, store, process, display, distribute, transmit, or review material that is abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, pornographic, profane or racist; that promotes hate crimes, or is subversive or objectionable by nature, including material encouraging criminal activity, or violation of local, state, federal, or international law.
<ol>
<span></span>

I understand I am prohibited from:
<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=9 type=1>
 <ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a>
  <li>Using the system for personal financial gain such as advertising or solicitation of services or sale of personal property (e.g., eBay), or stock trading (e.g., issuing buy, hold or sell directions to an online broker).

  <li>Fundraising activities, either for profit or non-profit, unless the activity is specifically approved by the information system owner (e.g., Command social event fundraisers, charitable fundraisers, etc.) without approval.

  <li>Promoting partisan political activity.

  <li>Gambling, wagering, or placing of any bets.
  
  <li>Writing, forwarding, or participating in chain letters.
  
  <li>Posting personal home pages.
  
  <li>Transmitting copyright-protected material.
 </ol>
</ol>
<span></span>

I will utilize social media sites (e.g. Facebook, YouTube, etc.) only as authorized by job or duty description; for official government purposes; to conduct official business; or to release official agency information or other official communication. I may establish and use personal accounts only within a personal capacity. Personal accounts must have no connection to official agency sites and must not appear to be, or represent, official opinion or content. My identity could be misused as the general public's perception of official responsibility or openness. Social media sites cannot be used to conduct official business or release official agency information or any other official communication related to the job or government activities.

<span></span>
I will not divulge Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to anyone without a valid need-to-know. I will not remove materials containing PII from the work place without proper authorization. I will encrypt all email correspondence and attachments containing PII. If I receive email containing PII that isn't encrypted, I will notify my unit/directorate/activity ISSO.

<span></span>
I understand that systems are the property of the USG and are subject to automated or manual inspections in the conduct of normal administrative tasks including, but not limited to; security compliance; system configuration; review of authorized and unauthorized software; illegal or prohibited information; personal usage; policy violations; backup and recovery; or information classification reviews to ensure that the use is authorized and the system is secure.

<span></span>
I will follow procedures to report security violations and incidents; abnormal behavior; system or application errors; suspicious activity; chain e-mails; spam; virus warnings; missing equipment; or the presence of unknown installed programs in accordance with local policy. I will immediately report any discrepancies in system operations following any anti-virus definition update, protective security application configuration, system update, or failures to my unit/directorate/activity ISSM/ISSO.

<span></span>
I will complete the required Information Assurance training, e.g. DOD Information Assurance Awareness Training. I will participate in any other required training programs directed by DOD, Service/Agency or local policy.

<span></span>

CONSEQUENCES

<span></span>
I understand that access to a U.S. Government system or network is a revocable privilege, and that failure to comply with requirements is a violation of the trust extended to me and may result in one or more administrative or judicial actions such as, but not limited to:
<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=10 type=1>
<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a>
 <li>Chain of command revoking access or user privileges;
 <li>Counseling;
 <li>Adverse actions under the UCMJ, Civil, and/or criminal prosecution;
 <li>Discharge or loss of employment;
 <li>Security incident reporting; and/or
 <li>Revocation of security clearances and program accesses.
</ol>
</ol>

I know I am subject to disciplinary action for violations or abuse of access privileges in accordance with DoD and other applicable regulations and laws.
<span></span>

I understand that I may be subject to disciplinary action for any violation or abuse of access privileges.
<span></span>

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
<span></span>

I have read the foregoing requirements regarding the access of U.S. Government systems and networks, I understand and acknowledge the responsibilities associated with accessing and protecting the information contained therein.
