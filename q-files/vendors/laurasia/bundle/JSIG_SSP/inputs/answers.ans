project.system_env.facility_system_layout=The Facility layout is **the arrangement of work space which\, in general terms smooths the way to access facilities that have strong interaction**\. Its aims are similar regardless of whether the organizations are services or manufacturing\.

project.system_env.account_manangement_policy=User access policies include how new users are authorized and granted appropriate privileges\, as well as how these are reviewed and revoked when necessary and includes appropriate controls to prevent users obtaining unauthorized privileges or access\. Scope\.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccess control policy refers to a data security technique that **prevents unauthorized physical or remote access to company data**\. This technique aims to minimize the security risks to the physical and logical systems of an organization\.
project.system_info_technical.system_description=A mission statement is **a concise explanation of the organization\'s reason for existence**\. It describes the organization\'s purpose and its overall intention\. The mission statement supports the vision and serves to communicate purpose and direction to employees\, customers\, vendors and other stakeholders\.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMission and vision statements play three critical roles\: \(1\) **communicate the purpose of the organization to stakeholders**\, \(2\) inform strategy development\, and \(3\) develop the measurable goals and objectives by which to gauge the success of the organization\'s strategy\.
project.system_info_technical.system_architecture=The architecture of a system **reflects the way it is used\, and therefore changes as the system is used**\. For example\, an airport may be designed using an architecture where the control tower and departures lounge are close together in the same building\, while the control tower is further away in the same airport\.
project.system_info_technical.system_dataflow=Functional Architecture is a term that originates out of enterprise architecture\. **It deals with how systems function to carry out end\-to\-end processes in order to maximize efficiency**\. Like most topics involving ERP systems\, there are a few schools of thought when it comes to systems design\.\r\n\r\nLet\'s explore the difference between a functional and a technical design\. In short\, **the functional design contains information about what the proposed software should do\, while the technical design specifies how the software should be built**\. End\.
project.system_info_technical.system_users=A system user means a peace officer\, correctional officer\, test\-site operator\, or other testing site personnel designated by a law enforcement agency or correctional facility administrator to enter or extract information into\/from the Sobriety Program Information System\.\r\n\r\nThe five main categories of computer users are **small office \& home users\, home users\, mobile users\, power users\, and large business users**\.
