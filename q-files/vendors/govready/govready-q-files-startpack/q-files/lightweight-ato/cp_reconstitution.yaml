  title: Reconstitution (pre)
  prompt: |
    Terminology: Reconstitution and Concurrent Processing.

    **Reconstitution** is the process by which recovery activities are completed and
    normal system operations are resumed.  If the original facility is unrecoverable,
    the activities in this phase can also be applied to preparing a new permanent
    location to support system processing requirements.  A determination must be made
    whether the system has undergone significant change and will require reassessment
    and reauthorization.  The phase consists of two major activities: (1) validating
    successful reconstitution and (2) deactivation of the plan.

    **Concurrent Processing** is the process of running a system at two separate locations
    concurrently until there is a level of assurance that the recovered system is
    operating correctly and securely.

  title: Data Validation Testing
  prompt: |
    Describe your Contingency Plan's Data Validation Testing.

    **Validation data testing** is the process of testing and validating data to ensure
    that data files or databases have been recovered completely at the permanent location.

    Describe procedures for testing and validation of data to ensure that data is
    correct and up to date as of the last available backup.  Teams or persons responsible
    for each procedure must be identified.  An example of a validation data test for
    a moderate-impact system would be to compare a database audit log to the recovered
    database to make sure all transactions were properly updated.

  title: Functional Validation Testing
  prompt: |
    Describe your Contingency Plan's Functionality Testing.

    **Functionality Testing** is a process for verifying that all system functionality has been tested, and the system is ready to return to normal operations.

    Describe procedures for testing and validation functional and operational aspects of the system.

  title: Recovery Declaration Statement
  prompt: |-
    How will you declare that the system has been successfully recovered?

    Update or add to the template text below:
  type: longtext
  default: Upon successfully completing testing and validation, the **[Insert role]**
    will formally declare recovery efforts complete, and that {{project.system_info.system_name}}
    is in normal operations.  {{project.system_info.system_name}} business and technical
    POCs will be notified of the declaration by the Contingency Plan Coordinator.  The
    recovery declaration statement notifies the Contingency Plan Team and executive
    management that the {{project.system_info.system_name}} has returned to normal
    operations.
- id: cp_user_notification
  title: User Notification Procedure
  prompt: "How will you notify users the system has been recovered?\n\nAfter the recovery\
    \ declaration statement is made, notifications need to be sent to users and customers.\
    \  \n\nDescribe the notification procedures.  Ensure that the procedures described\
    \ are consistent with Service Level Agreements and contracts."

  title: Cleanup
  prompt: >-
    How will you cleanup after recovery?


    Cleanup is the process of cleaning up or dismantling any temporary recovery locations,
    restocking supplies used, returning manuals or other documentation to their original
    locations, and readying the system for a possible future contingency event.


    Describe cleanup procedures and tasks including cleanup roles and responsibilities.

- id: cp_returning_backup
  title: Returning Backup Assets
  prompt: "How will you return backups to appropriate state and location after recovery?\n\
    \nIt is important that all backup and installation assets used during recovery\
    \ be returned to the off-site data storage location.  \n\nProvide procedures for\
    \ returning retrieved backup or installation assets to its offsite data storage\
    \ location.  This may include proper logging and packaging of backup and installation\
    \ media, preparing for transportation, and validating that media is securely stored\
    \ at the offsite location."

- id: cp_backingup_restored_systems
  title: Backing-up Restored Systems
  prompt: >-
    How will you backup the recovered system?


    As soon as reasonable following recovery, the system must be fully backed up and
    a new copy of the current operational system stored for future recovery efforts.  This
    full backup is then kept with other system backups.


    Provide appropriate procedures for ensuring that a full system backup is conducted
    within a reasonable time frame, ideally at the next scheduled backup period.
