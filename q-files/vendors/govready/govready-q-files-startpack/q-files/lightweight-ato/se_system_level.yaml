  prompt: |-
    System Level Controls

    Certain controls exist only at the level of your overall IT System and cannot be easily attributed to re-used system components.

    In the future, this module will gather information about controls you manage at the System Level.
    For purposes of this LATO Pilot, we will inherit some sample System Level controls to show these controls in the SSP.

    Does this make sense? (Please answer "yes" to this question.  )
