  title: Specific Legal Authorities
  prompt: |
    What specific legal authorities and/or agreements permit and define the collection of information by the project in question? 
    
    List all statutory and regulatory authority for operating the project,
    including the authority to collect the information which will be listed in the next section. Explain
    how the statutory and regulatory authority permits collection and use of the
    information. 

    A simple citation without more information will not be sufficient for
    purposes of this document and will result in rejection of a Privacy Impact
    Assessment. Explain how the statutory and regulatory authority permits
    the project and the collection of the subject information. If the project collects
    Social Security numbers you must also identify the specific statutory authority
    allowing such collection.

    If you are relying on another component and/or agency, please list their
    legal authorities.
   
    Where information is received from a foreign government pursuant to an

  title: Privacy Act System of Records Notice (SORN)
  prompt: |
    What Privacy Act System of Records Notice(s) (SORN(s)) apply to the information?

    For all collections of PII where the information is retrieved by a personal
    identifier, the Privacy Act requires that the agency publish a SORN in the Federal
    Register. Include the Federal Register citation for the SORN. If the information
    used in the project did not require a SORN, explain why not.

    In some instances, an existing SORN (either program specific, DHS-wide,
    or Government-wide) may apply to the project’s collection of information. In
    other instances, a new SORN may be required.

  title: System Security Plan, Completed?
  prompt: |
    Has a system security plan been completed for the information system(s) supporting the project?

    Provide the date that the Authority to Operate (ATO) was granted or the
    date it is expected to be awarded. Note that all systems containing PII are
    categorized at a minimum as “moderate” under Federal Information Processing
    Standards Publication 199. If the project does not trigger the C&A requirement,
    state that along with an explanation.

    For a new project provide anticipated date of C&A completion.

  title: National Archived and Record Administration
  prompt: |
    Does a records retention schedule approved by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) exist?

    The project manager, in consultation with counsel and the component
    records management officer, must develop a records retention schedule for the
    records contained in the project that considers the minimum amount of time
    necessary to retain information while meeting the needs of the project. 

    After the project manager and component records management officer finalize the schedule
    based on the needs of the project, it is proposed to NARA for official approval.
    Consult with your records management office for assistance with this question if
    necessary. If a NARA-approved schedule does not exist, explain what stage the
    project is in developing and submitting a records retention schedule.
