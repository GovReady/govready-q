  title: Redress Procedures
  prompt: |
    What are the procedures that allow individuals to access their
    information?

    Describe any procedures or regulations your component has in place that
    allow access to information collected by the system or project and/or to an
    accounting of disclosures of that information. Generally speaking, these
    procedures should include the Department’s FOIA/Privacy Act practices. If the
    Privacy Act does not apply, state why this is the case. If additional mechanisms
    exist, include those in this section. For example, if your component has a
    customer satisfaction unit, that information, along with phone and email contact
    information, should be listed in this section in addition to the Department’s
    procedures.

    If the system is exempt from the access provisions of the Privacy Act,
    explain the basis for the exemption and cite the Final Rule published in the Code
    of Federal Regulations (CFR) that explains this exemption. If the project is not a
    Privacy Act system, explain what procedures and/or regulations are in place that
    cover an individual gaining access to his/her own information.

  title: Correction Procedures
  prompt: |
    What procedures are in place to allow the subject individual to
    correct inaccurate or erroneous information?

    Discuss the procedures for individuals to address possibly inaccurate or
    erroneous information. 

    If the correction procedures are the same as those given in the previous
    question, state as much. If the system has exempted itself from the provisions
    of the Privacy Act, explain why individuals may not access their records.

  title: Notification Procedures
  prompt: |
    How does the project notify individuals about the procedures for
    correcting their information? 

    Individuals may be made aware of redress procedures through the notices
    described above or through some other mechanism. This question is
    meant to address the risk that even if procedures exist to correct information, if an
    individual is not made fully aware of the existence of those procedures, then the
    benefits of the procedures are weakened significantly.
  examples:
    - example: |
        Some programs provide the information related to redress in a
        letter when an individual is given an initial negative determination regarding
        receiving a particular benefit. This would give the individual clear notice of how
        to address possible problems with the information the Department holds on him.
        Other programs depend upon a notice in the workplace rather than direct notice
        to the individual, so redress may be more difficult for the individual.

  title: PIA, Related to Redress
  prompt: |
    Discuss what, if any, redress program the project provides beyond the
    access and correction afforded under the Privacy Act and FOIA. 
  examples:
    - example: |
        Some projects allow users to directly access and correct/update
        their information online. This helps ensures data accuracy. 
    - example: |
        If a project does not allow individual access, the risk of
        inaccurate data needs to be discussed in light of the purpose of the project. For
        example, providing access to ongoing law enforcement activities could negatively
        impact the program’s effectiveness because the individuals involved might change
        their behavior.
