    This plan has been developed to recover and reconstitute the [[Information System
    Name]]; using a three-phased approach.  The approach ensures that system recovery
    and reconstitution efforts are performed in a methodical sequence to maximize
    the effectiveness of the recovery and reconstitution efforts and minimize system
    outage time due to errors and omissions.  The three system recovery phases consist
    of activation and notification, recovery, and reconstitution.


    1. **Activation and Notification Phase**.  Activation of the ISCP occurs after
    a disruption, outage, or disaster that may reasonably extend beyond the RTO established
    for a system.  The outage event may result in severe damage to the facility that
    houses the system, severe damage or loss of equipment, or other damage that typically
    results in long-term loss.

    Once the ISCP is activated, the information system stakeholders are notified of
    a possible long-term outage, and a thorough outage assessment is performed for
    the information system.  Information from the outage assessment is analyzed and
    may be used to modify recovery procedures specific to the cause of the outage.

    2. **Recovery Phase.**  The Recovery phase details the activities and procedures
    for recovery of the affected system.  Activities and procedures are written at
    a level such that an appropriately skilled technician can recover the system without
    intimate system knowledge.  This phase includes notification and awareness escalation
    procedures for communication of recovery status to system stakeholders.

    3. **Reconstitution.**  The Reconstitution phase defines the actions taken to
    test and validate system capability and functionality at the original or new permanent
    location.  This phase consists of two major activities: validating data and operational
    functionality followed by deactivation of the plan.


    During validation, the system is tested and validated as operational prior to
    returning operation to its normal state.  Validation procedures include functionality
    or regression testing, concurrent processing, and/or data validation.  The system
    is declared recovered and operational by upon successful completion of validation
    testing.


    Deactivation includes activities to notify users of system operational status.  This
    phase also addresses recovery effort documentation, activity log finalization,
    incorporation of lessons learned into plan updates, and readying resources for
    any future events.
