  PRIVACY THRESHOLD ANALYSIS (PTA)
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  This form serves as the official determination by the DOS Privacy Office to identify the privacy compliance requirements for all Departmental uses of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
</p>
</div>

<div style="font-family: TimesNewRoman, Times, serif; text-indent: 3em;">
<p>
  A Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) serves as the document used to identify information technology (IT) systems, information collections/forms, technologies, rulemakings, programs, information sharing arrangements, or pilot projects that involve PII and other activities that otherwise impact the privacy of individuals as determined by the Chief Privacy Officer and to assess whether there is a need for additional Privacy Compliance Documentation. A PTA includes a general description of the IT system, information collection, form, technology, rulemaking, program, pilot project, information sharing arrangement, or other Department activity and describes what PII is collected (and from whom) and how that information is used and managed.
</p>

<p>
  Please complete the attached Privacy Threshold Analysis and submit it to your component Privacy Office.  After review by your component Privacy Officer the PTA is sent to the Department’s Senior Director for Privacy Compliance for action. If you do not have a component Privacy Office, please send the PTA to the DOS Privacy Office:
</p>

<p>
  Upon receipt from your component Privacy Office, the DOS Privacy Office will review this form and assess whether any privacy compliance documentation is required. If compliance documentation is required – such as Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Act Statement, or Computer Matching Agreement (CMA) – the DOS Privacy Office or component Privacy Office will send you a copy of the relevant compliance template to complete and return.
