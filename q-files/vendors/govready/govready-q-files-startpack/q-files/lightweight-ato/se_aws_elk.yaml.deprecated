    (ELK): ELK is implemented to audit the execution of privileged
    functionality at the application level. The ISSO has configured ELK such that
    privileged functionality (e.g. ability to configure access permissions) has been
    identified, logged, and audited.

    System-generated audit report identifying privileged functions are logged and
    audited independently. AWS UAR forms are used to track user and level of access.
    Kibana stores all activity logs and can be queried for audit information.
