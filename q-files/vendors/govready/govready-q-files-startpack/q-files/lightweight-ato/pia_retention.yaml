  title: Length and Reason for Retention
  prompt: |
    The purpose of this question is to identify the specific types of information
    the project retains. Is all the information the project collects retained? Is there a
    specific sub set of information retained? 

    This section should explain the nexus between the original purpose for the
    collection and this retention period. The minimum amount of information should
    be maintained for the minimum amount of time in order to support the project.

    In some cases, agencies may choose to retain files in active status and archive
    them after a certain period of time. State active file retention periods as well as
    archived records, in number of years, as well as the approved or proposed NARA
    records schedule. Discuss when the time periods begin for inputs, outputs, and
    master files. Project managers should work with component records officers early
    in the development process to ensure that appropriate retention and destruction
    schedules are implemented.
  examples:
    - example: |
        A project may collect extensive PII initially for the purpose of
        verifying the identity of an individual for a background check. Upon completion
        of the background check, the project will maintain the new information, the
        results of the background check (approved/not approved) and delete all
        application information.
    - example: |
        The project retains the information for the period of time in
        which fraud could be prosecuted and then the information is deleted.

  title: PIA, Related to Retention
  prompt: |
    Discuss the risks associated with the length of time data is retained. How
    were those risks mitigated?

    Although establishing retention periods for records is a formal process,
    there are policy considerations behind how long a project keeps information. The
    longer a project retains information, the longer it needs to secure the information
    and assure its accuracy and integrity. The proposed schedule should match the
    requirements of the Privacy Act to keep the minimum amount of PII for the
    minimum amount of time, while meeting the Federal Records Act. The schedule
    should align with the stated purpose and mission of the system.
