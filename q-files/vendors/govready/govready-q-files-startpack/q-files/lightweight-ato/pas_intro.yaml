  prompt: "This section will be about your Privacy Act Statement. \n\nWhen you request\
    \ an individual to furnish personal information (name, date of birth, social security\
    \ number, etc) for a system of records, regardless of the method used to collect\
    \ the information (i.e., forms, personal or telephonic interview, etc), you are\
    \ mandated to provide a Privacy Act Statement.\n\nThe Privacy Act of 1974, 5 USC\
    \ 552a, provides protection to individuals by ensuring that\npersonal information\
    \ collected by Federal agencies is limited to that which is legally authorized\n\
    and necessary and is maintained in a manner which precludes unwarranted intrusions\
    \ upon\nindividual privacy.\n\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. §552a (e) (3) agencies are\
    \ required to provide what is commonly referred to\nas a Privacy Act Statement\
    \ to all persons asked to provide personal information about\nthemselves, which\
    \ will go into a system of records (i.e., the information will be stored and\n\
    retrieved using the individual’s name or other personal identifier such as a Social\
    \ Security\nNumber). Organization policy is to provide a Privacy Act\nStatement\
    \ regardless of whether the collection is part of a system of records or not.\
    \ All Privacy\nAct statements must be reviewed by the Privacy Office or component\
    \ Privacy Officer"
