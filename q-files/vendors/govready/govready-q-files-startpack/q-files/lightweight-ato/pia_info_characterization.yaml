  title: Information Sources
  prompt: |
    What are the sources of the information and how is the information collected for the project?

    A project may collect information directly from an individual, receive it
    via computer readable extract from another system, or create the information
    itself.

    If information is being collected from sources other than the individual,
    including other IT systems, systems of records, commercial data aggregators, 
    and/or other Departments, state the source(s) and explain why information from
    sources other than the individual is required.

  title: Commercial and Public Information
  prompt: |
    Does the project receive commercial or publicly available information?

    Commercial data includes information from data aggregators such as
    Choice Point or Lexis Nexis, where the information was originally collected by a
    private organization for non-governmental purposes, such as marketing or credit
    reporting.

    Publicly available data includes information obtained from the internet,
    news feeds, or from state or local public records, such as court records where the
    records are received directly from the state or local agency, rather than from a
    commercial data aggregator.

  title: Information Accuracy
  prompt: |
    Explain how the project checks the accuracy of the information and 
    describe the process used for checking accuracy. 

    If a commercial data
    aggregator is involved describe the levels of accuracy required by the contract.
    
    Sometimes information is assumed to be accurate, or in R&D, inaccurate
    information may not have an impact on the individual or the project. 

    If the
    project does not check for accuracy, please explain why.
    
    Describe any technical solutions, policies, or procedures focused on
    improving data accuracy and integrity of the project. 
  examples:
  - example: |
      The project may check the information provided by the
      individual against any other source of information (within or outside your
      organization) before the project uses the information to make decisions about an
      individual.
