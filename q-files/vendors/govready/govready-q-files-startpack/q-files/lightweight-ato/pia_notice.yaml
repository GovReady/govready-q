  title: Notice Before Collection
  prompt: |
    How does the project provide individuals notice prior to the
    collection of information? If notice is not provided, explain why
    not. 

    In many cases, agencies provide written or oral notice before they collect
    information from individuals. That notice may include a posted privacy policy, a
    Privacy Act statement on forms, a PIA, or a SORN published in the Federal
    Register. 

    Describe what notice was provided to the individuals whose information
    is collected by this project. If notice was provided in the Federal Register
    provide the citation, (e.g. XX FR XXXX, Date).

    If notice was provided in a Privacy Act statement, attach a copy of the
    notice for review. Describe how the notice provided for the collection of
    information is adequate to inform those impacted.

    Consult your privacy office and legal counsel on issues concerning the
    notice to the public for an information collection such as a form.
    
    If notice was not provided, explain why. For certain law enforcement
    projects, notice may not be appropriate â€“ this section of the PIA would then
    explain how providing direct notice to the individual at the time of collection
    would undermine the law enforcement mission.

  title: User Consent
  prompt: |
    What opportunities are available for individuals to consent to
    uses, decline to provide information, or opt out of the project? 

    This question is directed at whether the individual from or about whom
    information is collected can decline to provide the information and if so, whether
    the consequences of providing the information are included in the notice.

    Additionally, state whether an individual may provide consent for specific
    uses or whether consent is given to cover all uses (current or potential) of his/her
    information. If specific consent is permitted or required, how does the individual
    consent to each use?

    If notice is provided to explain how an individual may exercise the right to
    consent to particular uses or decline to provide information describe the process.
    If this is not an option, explain why not. In some cases, declining to provide
    information simply means the individual chooses not to participate in the project.

  title: Related to Notice
  prompt: |
    Discuss how the notice provided corresponds to the purpose of the project
    and the stated uses. 

    Discuss how the notice given for the initial collection is
    consistent with the stated use(s) of the information. 

    Describe how the project has
    mitigated the risks associated with potentially insufficient notice and opportunity
    to decline or consent.
