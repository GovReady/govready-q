<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

{{project.speedy_ssp_additional_info.system_description}}

<!-- /System Information -->

<h2>1.  INFORMATION SYSTEM NAME/TITLE</h2>

This System Security Plan provides an overview of the security requirements for the Information System Name (Enter Information System Abbreviation) and describes the controls in place or planned for implementation to provide a level of security appropriate for the information to be transmitted, processed or stored by the system.  Information security is vital to our critical infrastructure and its effective performance and protection is a key component of our national security program.  Proper management of information technology systems is essential to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data transmitted, processed or stored by the Enter Information System Abbreviation information system.

The security safeguards implemented for the Enter Information System Abbreviation system meet the policy and control requirements set forth in this System Security Plan.  All systems are subject to monitoring consistent with applicable laws, regulations, agency policies, procedures and practices.

<!-- Information System Table goes -->

<h2>2.  INFORMATION SYSTEM CATEGORIZATION</h2>

The overall information system sensitivity categorization is recorded in Table 2 1. Security Categorization that follows.  Directions for attaching the FIPS 199 document may be found in the following section: Attachment 10, FIPS 199.

**Table 2-1. Security Categorization**

<!-- security categorization table goes here -->
<table class="table-ssp" border="1">
    <tr>
      <th class="th-header">System Sensitivity Level</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>{{project.speedy_ssp_basic_info.fisma_level}}</td>
    </tr>

<h3>2.1 Information Types</h3>

This section describes how the information types used by the information system are categorized for confidentiality, integrity and availability sensitivity levels.

The following tables identify the information types that are input, stored, processed and/or output from Enter Information System Abbreviation.  The selection of the information types is based on guidance provided by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office Business Reference Model 2.0 and FIPS Pub 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems which is based on NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories.

The tables also identify the security impact levels for confidentiality, integrity and availability for each of the information types expressed as low, moderate, or high.  The security impact levels are based on the potential impact definitions for each of the security objectives (i.e., confidentiality, integrity and availability) discussed in NIST SP 800-60 and FIPS Pub 199.
The potential impact is low if—

* The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
* A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial loss; or (iv) result in minor harm to individuals.

The potential impact is moderate if—

* The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
* A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals that does not involve loss of life or serious life threatening injuries.

The potential impact is high if—

* The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
* A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a severe degradation in or loss of mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is not able to perform one or more of its primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in major financial loss; or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life threatening injuries.

    </tr>
</table>


<h2>2.2 Security Objectives Categorization</h2>
Based on the information provided in Table 2 2. Sensitivity Categorization of Information Types, for the Enter Information System Abbreviation, default to the high-water mark for the Information Types as identified in Table 2 3. Security Impact Level below.

**Table 2-3. Security Impact Level**

<table class="table-ssp" border="1">
    <tr>
      <th class="th-header">Security Impact Review</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Your system's FISMA Level is {{project.speedy_ssp_basic_info.fisma_level}}.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Information Types: N/A /td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Impact Level based on Information Types: {{project.speedy_ssp_basic_info.fisma_level}}</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Through review and analysis, it has been determined that the baseline security categorization for the Enter Information System Abbreviation system is listed in the Table 2 4. Baseline Security Configuration that follows.

**Table 2-4. Baseline Security Configuration**

<!-- Security Impact Level Table goes here -->
<table class="table-ssp" border="1">

      <td>{{project.speedy_ssp_basic_info.fisma_level}}</td>
    </tr>
</table>


Using this categorization, in conjunction with the risk assessment and any unique security requirements, we have established the security controls for this system, as detailed in this SSP.

<h2>13. MINIMUM SECURITY CONTROLS</h2>

Security controls must meet minimum security control baseline requirements.  Upon categorizing a system as Low, Moderate, or High sensitivity in accordance with FIPS 199, the corresponding security control baseline standards apply.  Some of the control baselines have enhanced controls which are indicated in parentheses.

Security controls that are representative of the sensitivity of Enter Information System Abbreviation are described in the sections that follow.  Security controls that are designated as “Not Selected” or “Withdrawn by NIST” are not described unless they have additional FedRAMP controls.  Guidance on how to describe the implemented standard can be found in NIST 800-53, Rev 4.  Control enhancements are marked in parentheses in the sensitivity columns.

Systems that are categorized as FIPS 199 Low use the controls designated as Low, systems categorized as FIPS 199 Moderate use the controls designated as Moderate and systems categorized as FIPS 199 High use the controls designated as High.
