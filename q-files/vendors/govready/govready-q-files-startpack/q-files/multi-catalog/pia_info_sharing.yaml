  title: External Sharing
  prompt: |
    Is information shared outside of the agency as part of the normal
    agency operations? 

    If so, identify the organization(s) and how the
    information is accessed and how it is to be used.

    Discuss the external Departmental sharing of information (for example,
    CBP to FBI). Identify the name or names of the federal agencies and foreign
    governments. 

    For state or local government agencies, or private sector organizations list
    the general types rather than the specific names. 
  examples:
    - example: |
        Customs and Border Protection may share biographic
        information on an individual with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in order for
        FBI to conduct a background check. Alternatively, USVISIT may share
        biographic and biometric information with the intelligence community in order to
        identify possible terrorists.
    - example: |
        The program shares information with state fusion centers that
        have a posted privacy policy. In particular, discuss any international agreements
        that require information sharing as part of normal agency operations.

  title: External Sharing, SORN
  prompt: |
    Describe how the external sharing listed in the previous question is compatible with the SORN noted previously.
  examples:
    - example: |
        Routine use H allows DHS to share biographic information with
        the FBI to conduct a background check. This is compatible with the original
        collection because the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) requires that
        USCIS determine whether an individual has committed any disqualifying crimes.
        Without checking with the FBI, DHS would be unable to meet this requirement of
        the law.

  title: Re-dissemination
  prompt: |
    Does the project place limitations on re-dissemination?

    Describe any limitations that may be placed on external agencies further
    sharing the information provided by DHS. In some instances, the external agency
    may have a duty to share the information, for example through the information
    sharing environment. But, before disclosing the information to the individual the
    external agency is required to verify with DHS.

  title: Record of Discolsure
  prompt: |
    List what information is retained as part of the accounting
    requirement.

    A separate system does not need to be created to meet the
    accounting requirement, but the program must be able to recreate the information
    noted above to demonstrate compliance. If the project does not, explain why not.

  title: PIA, Related to Information Sharing
  prompt: |
    Discuss the privacy risks associated with the sharing of information
    outside of the Department. 

    How were those risks mitigated?
    Discuss whether access controls have been implemented and whether
    audit logs are regularly reviewed to ensure appropriate sharing outside of the
    Department. For example, is there a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU),
    contract, or agreement in place with outside agencies or foreign governments.
    Discuss how the sharing of information outside of the Department is
    compatible with the stated purpose and use of the original collection.
