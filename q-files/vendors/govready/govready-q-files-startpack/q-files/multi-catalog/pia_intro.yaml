  prompt: |
    Provide a paragraph summary that describes the system. 

    The abstract is composed of a minimum of three senteces. It should conform to the following format:

      • First sentence should include the name of the component and the system,
        technology, pilot, rule, program, or other collection. 

      • Second sentence should be a brief description of the project and its function.

      • Third sentence should explain the reason the program is being created and why
      the PIA is required. This sentence should embody the same analysis that caused
      the project to be identified as a “privacy sensitive system” in the PTA, such as the
      project requires PII or the technology is privacy sensitive.
