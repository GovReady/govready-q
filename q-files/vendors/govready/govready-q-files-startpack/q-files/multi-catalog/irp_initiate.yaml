    Introduction

    The first step to any Incident Response Plan is the 'Initiate Phase'. The 'Initiate Phase' typically includes instructions for the team member who discovers a potential security event, how that event is reported, the assigning of initial roles and responsibilities, and other important tasks.

  title: Incident Definition
  prompt: |
    How does {{project.system_info.system_org}}'s incident response team define an incident?

  examples:
    - example: |
        An incident begins when someone becomes aware of a potential incident.
        We define "incident" broadly, following NIST SP 800-61, as "a violation
        or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, 
        acceptable use policies, or standard security practices". This is a 
        deliberately broad definition, designed to encompass any scenario that
        might threaten the security of a system.

  title: Immediate Actions
  prompt: |
    When a security related incident is noticed by a team member, what actions should they immediately take? 
    Who should they contact immediately? Where should their attention be directed?

  examples:
    - example: |
        When someone notices what appears to be a security-related incident, they should check the documentation 
        to see if this may be expected behavior (e.g., expected system downtime during a maintenance window) and 
        if necessary alert the on-call system administrators listed in the documentation via email. If they don't get 
        acknowledgment from the Incident Response team within 10 minutes, they should escalate by contacting the 
        Departmental Incident Response Team directly until they receive acknowledgment of their report.

  title: Roles and Responsibilities
  prompt: |
    What important roles are needed to be defined in the initiation step of the response process? What do those roles do? 
  examples:
    - example: |
        The first participant on the Departmental Incident Response Team becomes the initial Incident Commander (IC) and 
        carries out the next steps in the response. The IC's responsibility is coordination, not necessarily investigation. 
        The IC's primary role is to guide the process. The first responder may remain IC throughout the process, or they may
         hand off IC duties later in the process.

        The IC makes sure that the incident response process is followed, including supporting the reporter if the reporter 
        already started it, or starting it if nobody has started it yet.

  title: Communication and Reporting
  prompt: |
    How is the initial incident or event being communicated to other members of the greater team and incident response team?

    In reporting, are there specific means of communicating incidents like forms or templates? What does the team used to 
    communicate about an incident?
  examples:
    - example: |
        Note that at this point the event's status is "investigating" â€” we haven't confirmed that it's really an issue yet. 
        So, we should actually refer to this as just an "event" at this point; it doesn't become an "incident" until we've confirmed it.

        Email template:
        - Short description of what is occurring with {{project.system_info.system_name}}
        - Status: investigating
        - Severity: unknown
        - Reporter: WHO INITIALLY REPORTED THE ISSUE
        - IC: YOUR NAME
        - Responders: ANY OTHER RESPONDERS
        - ANY EXTRA DETAILS ABOUT THE ISSUE

        The IC is responsible for keeping this issue up-to-date as investigation 
        and remediation progresses. Everyone involved in the issue (responders) 
        should leave notes as comments on the issue.
