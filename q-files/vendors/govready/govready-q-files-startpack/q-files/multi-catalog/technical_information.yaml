    What are information types? And how are they categorized?

    Information types are kinds of commonly used data highlighted by NIST SP 800-60, Volumes I and II.
    In this section, we will describe how the information type is being used and will categorize the information by its
    confidentiality, integrity, and availability sensitivity levels.
