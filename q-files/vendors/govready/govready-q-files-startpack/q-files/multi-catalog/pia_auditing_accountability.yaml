  title: Information Used in Accordance with PIA
  prompt: |
    How does the project ensure that the information is used in
    accordance with stated practices in this PIA?

    Auditing measures are recommended and should be discussed, but other
    possible technical and policy safeguards such as information sharing protocols,
    special access restrictions, and other controls should be discussed here as well.
    
    Do the audit measures discussed above include the ability to identify
    specific records each user can access? Describe the different roles in general
    terms that have been created to provide access to the project information. For
    example, certain users may have "read-only" access while others may be
    permitted to make certain amendments or changes to the information.

    Explain whether the project conducts self audits, third party audits,
    reviews by the Office of Inspector General or Government Accountability Office
    (GAO).

    Does the IT system have automated tools to indicate when information is
    possibly being misused?
  examples:
    - example: |
        If certain celebrity records are accessed, a supervisor is notified
        and reviews to ensure that the records were properly used.

  title: Privacy Training
  prompt: |
    Describe what privacy training is provided to users either
    generally or specifically relevant to the project.

    DHS offers privacy and security training. Each project may offer training
    specific to the project, which touches on information handling procedures and
    sensitivity of information. Discuss how individuals who have access to PII are
    trained to appropriately handle it.

    Explain what controls are in place to ensure that users of the system have
    completed training relevant to the project.

  title: Determining Access
  prompt: |
    What procedures are in place to determine which users may
    access the information and how does the project determine who
    has access?

    Describe the process and authorization by which an individual receives
    access to the information held by the project, both electronic and paper based
    records. Identify users from other agencies who may have access to the project
    information and under what roles these individuals have such access. Describe the
    different roles in general terms that have been created that permit access to such
    project information.

    Specifically, if remote access to the system is allowed or external storage
    or communication devices interact with the system, describe any measures in
    place to secure the transmission and storage of data (e.g., encryption and/or twofactor authentication).
  examples:
    - example: |
        Certain users may have "read-only" access while others may be
        permitted to make certain amendments or changes to the information.

  title: Approve Information Sharing
  prompt: |
    How does the project review and approve information sharing
    agreements, MOUs, new uses of the information, new access to the
    system by organizations within DHS and outside?

  examples:
    - example: |
        All MOUs are reviewed by the program manager, component
        Privacy Officer, and counsel and then sent to DHS for formal review.
