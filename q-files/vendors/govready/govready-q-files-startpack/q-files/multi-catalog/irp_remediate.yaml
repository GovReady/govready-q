    Introduction

    The third step to any Incident Response Plan is the 'Remediate Phase'. The 'Remediate Phase' involves the capture of incident-relevant information, the potential containment of the issue, and the tracking of the investigation efforts. Remediation will always be tailored to the situation dependent on the activity.

  title: Remediation Steps

  examples:
    - example: |
        The IC is likewise responsible for tracking those, making sure they're assigned and followed-up, and verifying them as they're completed. 
        These may be tracked in the central issue as well. 
        The IC should distinguish between immediate concerns which should be completed before the incident is considered resolved and long-term improvements/hardening which can be deferred to the Retrospective.

  title: Service Disruption
  prompt: |
    How do incident response teams remediate service disruption?
  examples:
    - example: |
        The team should proceed in a different way depending on the severity.

        - For High Severity:  the team should take action immediately, even if this causes disruption. A notification about the disruption should be sent out as soon as possible, but the team needs no permission to take action at this level.

        - For Medium Severity: the team should notify the Product Owners and Tech Leads of the planned action, and help them assess the relative risk of disruption vs. security. If the leads are unavailable via Slack, they should be contacted using the phone numbers in their Slack profiles. The team should reach a collaborative decision on action, with a bias towards disruption. If they can't be reached within 1 hour, the team may take action without them.

        - For Low Severity: the team should notify as above, and not take action until a mutually-agreed-on course of action has been determined.
