- id: q1
  title: Information Usage, Reasoning and Methods
  prompt: |
    Describe how and why the project uses the information.

    List each use (internal and external to the Department) of the information
    collected or maintained. Provide a detailed response that states how and why the 
    different data elements will be used. If Social Security numbers are collected,
    state why the SSN is necessary and how it was used.
  examples:
    - example: |
        A project needs to collect name, date of birth, and passport
        information because that information provides the best matching capabilities
        against the terrorist screening database.

  title: Usage of Predictive and Querying Technology
  prompt: |
    Does the project use technology to conduct electronic searches,
    queries, or analyses in an electronic database to discover or locate
    a predictive pattern or an anomaly? 

    If so, state how the agency plans to
    use such results.

    Many projects sift through large amounts of information in response to
    user inquiry or programmed functions. Projects may help identify areas that were
    previously not identifiable and need additional research by agents, analysts, or
    other employees. Some projects perform complex analytical tasks resulting in
    other types of data, matching, relational analysis, scoring, reporting, or pattern
    analysis.

    Discuss the results generated by the uses described in the previous question, including a
    background determination, link analysis, a score, or other analysis. These results
    may be generated electronically by the information system or manually through
    review by an analyst. Explain what will be done with the newly derived
    information.

    Will the results be placed in the individual's existing record? Will a new
    record be created? Will any action be taken against or for the individual identified
    because of the newly derived data? If a new record is created, will the newly
    created information be accessible to government employees who make
    determinations about the individual? If so, explain fully under which
    circumstances and by whom that information will be used.
  examples:
    - example: |
        The system will generate a response that there is a possible
        match to the terrorist screening database. This possible match will be maintained
        in the system with the information previously provided by the individual. A
        trained analyst will review the possible match and make a determination as to
        whether or not the individual is on the list. This determination will also be
        maintained in the system.

  title: Assigned Roles and Responsibilities
  prompt: |
    Are there other components with assigned roles and
    responsibilities within the system?

    Discuss the intra-Departmental sharing of information.

    Identify and list the name(s) of any components or directorates within the
    Department with which the information is shared. 
  example:
    - example: |
        Certain systems regularly share information because of the
        cross over of the missions of the different parts of DHS. For example, USCIS
        employees regularly use a CBP system to verify whether an individual has entered
        the country. USCIS employees note that the CBP system has been checked and
        the date on which it was checked, but do not copy the information to the USCIS
        system.

  title: PIA, Related to the Uses of Information
  prompt: |
    Describe any types of controls that may be in place to ensure that
    information is handled in accordance with the uses described above. 
  example:
    - example: |
        Describe if training for users of the project covers how to
        appropriately use information. Describe the disciplinary programs or system
        controls (i.e. denial of access) that are in place if an individual is inappropriately
        using the information.
