    <h3>AC-1: Access Control Policy And Procedures</h3>

    <blockquote>The organization:
    a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
    a.1. An access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    a.2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access controls; and
    b. Reviews and updates the current:
    b.1. Access control policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
    b.2. Access control procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].</blockquote>


    The Department develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal, documented, access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, and compliance, and formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access controls.

    **In-Place Controls:**

    Access control policy and procedures are documented in the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} SSP. Access to {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System operational information or system resources is limited to only authorized users, programs or processes. The Department enforces access control policies to protect the integrity of the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System system. This Department reviews and updates this policy as necessary and it has been being updated, as necessary, since April 2008.

    **Control Type:** Common

    Additional information is contained within the Department of Sobriety, Handbook for Information Assurance Security Policy.

    <h3>AC-2: Account Management</h3>

    <blockquote>The organization:
    a. Identifies and selects the following types of information system accounts to support organizational missions/business functions: [Assignment: organization-defined information system account types];
    b. Assigns account managers for information system accounts;
    c. Establishes conditions for group and role membership;
    d. Specifies authorized users of the information system, group and role membership, and access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account;
    e. Requires approvals by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] for requests to create information system accounts;
    f. Creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes information system accounts in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined procedures or conditions];
    g. Monitors the use of information system accounts;
    h. Notifies account managers:
    h.1. When accounts are no longer required;
    h.2. When users are terminated or transferred; and
    h.3. When individual information system usage or need-to-know changes;
    i. Authorizes access to the information system based on:
    i.1. A valid access authorization;
    i.2. Intended system usage; and
    i.3. Other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions;
    j. Reviews accounts for compliance with account management requirements [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
    k. Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group.</blockquote>


    Information system accounts are managed, including establishing, activating, modifying, reviewing, disabling, and removing accounts. Data owners must review access authorizations and Information system accounts at least annually to determine whether they remain appropriate and also must periodically re-certify users, including for single sign-on computers. Access control lists are compiled and are reviewed.

    **In-Place Controls:**

    Access privileges are used to ensure that only authorized personnel access certain areas of the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System system. User access is controlled by the completion and submission of {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System System Rules of Behavior and New User Account Request forms by the user and management. These items are completed and submitted whenever a new user requires access or an existing user requires access changes. The system administrator, based on need-to-know, assigns the proper permissions. The employee’s manager approves the access rights before the initial account is created by signing off on the forms. Finally, the system administrator implements the access rights according to the New User Account Request form. The security staff and the support contractor to determine recertification requirements review accounts periodically. Accounts no longer in use are removed from the system by the system administrator.

    The {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System has implemented user account procedures to disable inactive user accounts after 90-days of inactivity. The {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} support staff monitors all user accounts to ensure this procedure is enforced. The Authentication Management section of the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} SSP illustrates the exact procedures the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} support staff follows to ensure accounts are properly managed.
    The {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System system does not have guest or anonymous accounts.

    <h3>AC-3: Access Enforcement</h3>

    <blockquote>The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.</blockquote>



    The information system enforces assigned authorizations for controlling access to the system in accordance with applicable policy.

    **In-Place Controls:**

    The {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System ensures that assigned authorizations for controlling access to the system is enforced in accordance with the user definitions noted in the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} SSP. The technical support staff ensures that access to security functions and protected information is restricted to authorized personnel. Access will be controlled with access control list used on each device. Members of one group cannot access resources defined for other groups unless explicitly permitted.

    <h3>AC-7: Unsuccessful Logon Attempts</h3>

    <blockquote>The information system:
    a. Enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and
    b. Automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for an [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; locks the account/node until released by an administrator; delays next logon prompt according to [Assignment: organization-defined delay algorithm]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.</blockquote>


    The information system enforces a limit of three consecutive invalid access attempts by a user within any time period.

    The information system automatically locks the account/node indefinitely or until an administrator unlocks the account when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.

    **In-Place Controls:**

    The {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System system locks out users after three unsuccessful login attempts. The information system automatically locks the account permanently, unless an administrator unlocks the account before then, when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts (3) is exceeded.

    <h3>AC-8: System Use Notification</h3>

    <blockquote>The information system:
    a. Displays to users [Assignment: organization-defined system use notification message or banner] before granting access to the system that provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance and states that:
    a.1. Users are accessing a U.S. Government information system;
    a.2. Information system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;
    a.3. Unauthorized use of the information system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and
    a.4. Use of the information system indicates consent to monitoring and recording;
    b. Retains the notification message or banner on the screen until users acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to or further access the information system; and
    c. For publicly accessible systems:
    c.1. Displays system use information [Assignment: organization-defined conditions], before granting further access;
    c.2. Displays references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities; and
    c.3. Includes a description of the authorized uses of the system.</blockquote>


    The information system displays an approved, system use notification message before granting system access informing potential users: (i) that the user is accessing a U.S. Government information system; (ii) that system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit; (iii) that unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and (iv) that use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording. The system use notification message provides appropriate privacy and security notices (based on associated privacy and security policies or summaries) and remains on the screen until the user takes explicit actions to log on to the information system.

    **In-Place Controls:**

    A warning banner ensures that all persons attempting to gain access to the system know that the system and its information are “Authorized User Only” and that attempts to illegally log on to the system could lead to criminal prosecution. The warning message displayed notifies unauthorized users that they have accessed a U.S. Government computer system and continued, unauthorized use can be punishable by fines or imprisonment. Each device logged into will display a system use notification message before the log in window is displayed. The system use notification banner will remain on the screen until the user takes an explicit action to log on to the device. The following is the notification banner displayed on all Department devices:

    **WARNING:** This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals using this computer system without authority, or in excess of their authority, are subject to having all of their activities on this system monitored and recorded by system personnel. In the event of monitoring individuals improperly using this system, or in the event of system maintenance, the activities of authorized users may also be monitored.

    Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring and is advised that if such monitoring reveals possible evidence of criminal activity, system personnel may provide the evidence of such monitoring to law enforcement officials.

    <h3>AC-13: Supervision And Review - Access Control</h3>

    The Department supervises and reviews the activities of users with respect to the enforcement and usage of information system access controls.

    **In-Place Controls:**

    The Department or its designated support staff reviews the activities of users with respect to the enforcement and usage of information system access controls. The designated security officer will review audit records for inappropriate activities in accordance with the Department’s procedures on a weekly basis. Any unusual information system-related activities will be researched and investigated. The security officer will review any changes or additions to access authorizations. User activities are logged and the data reviewed by the system administrator and security officer on a weekly basis:

    * logon/logoff by User ID
    * password change
    * create/delete/open/close file name

    <h3>CA-7: Continuous Monitoring</h3>

    <blockquote>The organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a continuous monitoring program that includes:
    a. Establishment of [Assignment: organization-defined metrics] to be monitored;
    b. Establishment of [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for monitoring and [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for assessments supporting such monitoring;
    c. Ongoing security control assessments in accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy;
    d. Ongoing security status monitoring of organization-defined metrics in accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy;
    e. Correlation and analysis of security-related information generated by assessments and monitoring;
    f. Response actions to address results of the analysis of security-related information; and
    g. Reporting the security status of organization and the information system to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].</blockquote>


    Security controls in information systems are monitored on an ongoing basis, to include the following activities: configuration management, intrusion detection tools, vulnerability scanning, and status reporting, and assessing the security impact of changes to a system.

    **In-Place Controls:**

    The security controls for the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System are monitored on an ongoing basis. The Department, SOD , and their contractors perform vulnerability scanning, self-assessments, configuration management and employed intrusion detection tools to assess the security impact of the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System system throughout its lifecycle. Monitoring of the system is done with the OSSEC-HIDS tool, which sends email alerts to the system management team when it detects issues with the systems. The tool uses log-file analysis and dynamic system characteristics to detect potential issues with the system. The IDS code within the McAfee firewall logs alerts via syslog and that log is one of those constantly monitored by the OSSEC-HIDS tool. When incidents are discovered the ContractorCo team will work with the ISSO to report these incidents according to the Federal Agency Incident Categories and within the require reporting timeframe (References: <http://www.us-cert.gov/government-users/reporting-requirements.html> and the *Department of Sobriety Handbook for Information Security Incident Response and Reporting Procedures, Figure* 3.1).

    <h3>CP-9: Information System Backup</h3>

    <blockquote>The organization:
    a. Conducts backups of user-level information contained in the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives];
    b. Conducts backups of system-level information contained in the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives];
    c. Conducts backups of information system documentation including security-related documentation [Assignment: organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives]; and
    d. Protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup information at storage locations.</blockquote>


    The organization conducts backups of user-level and system-level information (including system state information) contained in the information system \[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] and stores backup information at an appropriately secured location.

    Supplemental Guidance: The frequency of information system backups and the transfer rate of backup information to alternate storage sites (if so designated) are consistent with the organization’s recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives.

    **In-Place Controls:**

    The technical support staff conducts backups of the VMs that make up the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} system using Acronis backup software to local disk backups. These backups are taken automatically, for the virtual machines. These local network backups are stored on disks that are also housed at the data center location in Annapolis, MD. The location is access-controlled and meets environmental requirements for fire protection and adequate temperature/humidity controls. The backed up information is tested at least monthly to verify that the information is being properly stored and to ensure media reliability and information integrity.

    <h3>IA-2: Identification And Authentication (Organizational Users)</h3>

    <blockquote>The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users).</blockquote>


    The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates users (or processes acting on behalf of users). The Department establishes guidelines for determining if multifactor authentication is required. An e-authentication risk assessment, per OMB M-04-04, must be conducted to determine the identification and authentication requirements for the system. However, should the assurance requirements determined by the e-authentication risk assessment be less than the minimum requirements of the IA-2 BLSR, than IA-2 shall override the results of the e-authentication risk assessment, and the system must meet the minimum requirements of IA-2.

    **In-Place Controls:**

    The {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System system uniquely identifies and authenticates all privileged and program users. This is accomplished through the use of unique user identification and a secret user password. All user IDs are maintained in a database by the system administrator and no identical IDs may be issued. The {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System system does not process sensitive information, thus it does not employ multifactor authentication.

    Password requirements are listed under security control IA-5.

    *The information system uses multifactor authentication for network access to privileged accounts.*

    **Planned Controls:**

    Privileged accounts, in the case of the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} system, include the users who have administrative access to the VMware and Windows systems and to the Unix systems where {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} is operating. Since no PIV-card type authentication scheme is in-place, and since the cost and complexity of implementing a PIV scheme is considered unnecessary given the size of the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} system, the contractor has implemented a scheme that leverages the standard username and password authentication, together with IP-based ACLs on access to all management services.

    GSMX maintainers have Remote Desktop (RDP) access from restricted IPs to REDACTED (via the `REDACTED` security group).

      * At least one number
      * At least one special character
      * At least one capitalized letter
      * At least one lower case letter
    * Passwords must be changed at least every 90 days, to reduce the possibility of being compromised through guessing, password cracking, and other means that could be employed to learn a user’s password
    * The password may not be reused in the next 10 changes and passwords can only be changed once every 24 hours
    * Group passwords must be changed every 90 days or if a member of the group no longer needs access to that group; if group passwords are used, no group passwords are in use on the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} system.
    * Users are notified five days before password expires
    * Null passwords are not allowed
    * Passwords will not be automated through the use of function keys, scripts, or other methods where passwords may be stored on system
    * Initial one time use authenticator may be distributed via e-mail or given in person
    * Forgotten, lost, compromised, or damaged authenticators will need to be reissued by the system administrator

    **In-Place Controls:**

    The {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System’s position sensitivity levels are assigned by the Department of Sobriety and National Classification Center (NCC) as part of the position designation required by OPM under 5 CFR 731.106. Each Department position designation is documented on the Standard Position Description (SPD) and assigned a risk level (or sensitivity level) commensurate with the sensitivity of the information, the risk to that information and the system maintaining that information. The levels of risk still need to be designated by the Department for employee and contractor positions but since the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System system does not have any sensitive data, a low risk scenario can be assumed. Employee risk levels and background investigations are: Low Risk= NACI, Moderate Risk= LBI, High Risk= BI. Contractor risk levels and background investigations are: Low Risk= NACI, Moderate Risk= NACC, High Risk= BI. In order to ensure every employee is assigned to a position, which has been reviewed for sensitivity by the NCC, the SPD is a required data attribute of an employee’s HR record. Position risks designations are reviewed and revised when NCC or OPM publish changes to sensitivity levels.

    Assessments are conducted of the risk and magnitude of harm that could result from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency.

    **Planned Controls:**

    Risk assessments will be conducted to ensure adequate security commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm that could result from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information or assets supporting the application. The risk assessment approach includes identification of threats, vulnerabilities, and the effectiveness of the current or planned security controls. A risk assessment has not been performed for this application; however, a risk assessment will be conducted in accordance with NIST SP 800-30 as part of the C&A process.

    A risk assessment is triggered when significant changes to the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} System occur. Some changes to the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} accreditation boundary can impact the overall security posture of the {{project.system_profile.system_basics.system_nickname}} Technology project. Some examples of what would constitute a risk assessment are as follows:

    -   Level of criticality and/or sensitivity change for the system/environment impacting reliable baseline countermeasures.

    -   Hardware additions, changes or upgrades requiring a change in the approved security countermeasures.

        -   A device is added to the current accreditation boundary (Example: New server)

    -   Software (operating system or applications) additions, changes or upgrades (e.g., additional functional and capability modules).

        -   Core version changes (Examples: Windows 2000 SP4 to Windows XP, Windows XP to SuSE Linux, Oracle 10g to 11g, Microsoft Access to SQL, etc.)

    -   Security policy (e.g., access control policy) changes.

    -   Threat change creating system vulnerability resulting in a higher risk.

    -   Mission changes requiring a different security mode of operation.

    -   Breaches of security, system integrity or unusual situations that appear to invalidate the accreditation by revealing flaws in security design exposing its vulnerability.

    -   Significant changes in the physical structure of the facility or the system is moved to a different facility.

    -   Significant changes in operating procedures.

        -   A new function is added to the application/system (Example: Application/System XYZ needs to work with FIPS 140-2 802.11b products wirelessly.)

    -   System configuration changes (e.g., a workstation connected outside of the approved accreditation parameters).

    -   Networks:

        -   Inclusion of additional (separately accredited) system(s) affecting the security of that system.

        -   Modification/replacement of a subscribing system affecting the security of that system.

        -   Results of an audit or external analysis.

        -   Addition of system interfaces with other systems.
