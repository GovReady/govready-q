### Applicability

**Note:**  This Incident Response Plan applies to systems for which {{project.system_info.system_org}} has negotiated and defined Incident Response/Contingency Plan (IRCP) operations. Each IRCP-managed system will have a specific, tailored version of this Incident Response Plan or in some cases a completely unique Incident Response Plan will be developed.
&nbsp;

### Overview

This Incident Response Plan provides baseline guidance for the {{project.system_info.system_org}}'s process for responding to security incidents and other disruptions of a {{project.system_info.system_org}} IRCP managed system, product or service ("system"). It outlines roles and responsibilities during and after incidents, and it lays out the steps we'll take to resolve them.

At a high level, incident response follows this process:
* Initiate
* Assess
* Remediate
* Retrospective
&nbsp;  

### Response process   

### **Initiate**
The first step to any Incident Response Plan is the 'Initiate Phase'. The 'Initiate Phase' typically includes instructions for the team member who discovers a potential security event, how that event is reported, the assigning of initial roles and responsibilities, and other important tasks.<br/>
&nbsp;
### Incident Definition

### Immediate Actions

### Roles and Responsibilities

&nbsp;
### Communication and Reporting
{{project.irp_initiate.q4}}
&nbsp;

### **Assess**
The second step to any Incident Response Plan is the 'Assess Phase'. The 'Assess Phase' typically includes the determination if an event is actually a confirmed security incident, how to figure out the severity of the incident, or whether or not to trigger the usage of a contingency.<br/>

&nbsp;
### Assessment Communication Strategy

&nbsp;

### **Remediate**
The third step to any Incident Response Plan is the 'Remediate Phase'. The 'Remediate Phase' involves the capture of incident-relevant information, the potential containment of the issue, and the tracking of the investigation efforts. Remediation will always be tailored to the situation dependent on the activity.<br/>

&nbsp;

### **Retrospective**
The final step to any Incident Response Plan is the 'Retrospective Phase'. The 'Retrospective Phase' typically includes figuring out lessons learned from the incident.<br/>

### How this document works

This plan is most effective if all {{project.system_info.system_org}} team members know about it, remember that it exists, have the ongoing opportunity to give input based on their expertise, and keep it up to date.

*   The {{project.system_info.system_org}} team is responsible for maintaining this document and updating it as needed. Any change to it must be approved and peer reviewed by at least another member of the team.
    *   All changes to the plan should be communicated to the rest of the team.
    *   At least once a year, and after major changes to our systems, we review and update the plan.
