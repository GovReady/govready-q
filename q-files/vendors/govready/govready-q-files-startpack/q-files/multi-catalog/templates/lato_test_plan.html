	Security Test Plan
</h2>


<h3>1	Introduction</h3>

<h4>1.1	Scope</h4>

The scope of the Security Test Plan (STP) is to ensure that there is a complete end-to-end integration testing of SAMS with dependent connections to secured working systems. It is also to ensure that all entities within management, implementation, operational, and oversight responsibilities have a clear understanding of their roles and associated functions with SAMS.

<h4>1.2	Background</h4>

SAMS will provide a mode of communication between HQ Executives, Directors of Field Operations, Port Directors, and Port Officers.  The application will allow HQ Executives to send emergency notifications and simple text notifications to Port Officers and get acknowledgements of the messages received.  The application will have location targeting abilities as well, which will allow for communications to specific Field Offices and specific Port Director.
