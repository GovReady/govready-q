    # Determine Your System's FISMA Level

    The first step in becoming FISMA compliant is categorization. In categorization, you
    determine the FISMA Level of your system, which may be "Low," "Moderate," or "High."

    {# FIPS 199 / NIST 800-60 Vol 1 #}

    * Your system is FISMA Low if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be
    expected to have a limited adverse effect, such as a degradation in mission capability, minor damage
    to organizational assets, minor financial loss, or minor harm to individuals.

    * Your system is FISMA Moderate if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be
    expected to have a serious adverse effect, such as a significant degradation in mission capability,
    significant damage to organizational assets, significant financial loss, or significant harm to individuals
    that does not involve loss of life or serious life threatening injuries.

    * Your system is FISMA High if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be
    expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations,
    organizational assets, or individuals, such as a loss of mission capability, major damage to
    organizational assets, major financial loss, or severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss
    of life or serious life threatening injuries.

    A FISMA Moderate system requires stronger security protections and compliance
    documentation than a FISMA Low system. A FISMA High system requires the most security
    protections and compliance documentation.

    Your system's FISMA level is based on the information contained in the system and the
    function of the system in achieving your agency's mission objectives. We will ask you
    about the information in and functions of your system in terms of confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability.

    Is the confidentiality impact level {{information_types_confidentiality_provisional}}?

    Based on the information type(s) you chose from NIST SP 800-60 Vol II, the provisional
    impact of a loss of confidentiality is **{{information_types_confidentiality_provisional}}**.

    A loss of confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information. What potential impact
    would a loss of confidentiality have?

    {% if information_types_confidentiality_provisional == "Low" %}
    The potential impact is Low if the loss of confidentiality could be expected to
    have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets,
    or individuals. A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of
    confidentiality might: (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent
    and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but
    the effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor
    damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial loss; or (iv)
    result in minor harm to individuals. (NIST SP 800-60 Vol 1 Rev 1){% endif %}

    {% if information_types_confidentiality_provisional == "Moderate" %}
    The potential impact is moderate if the loss of confidentiality could be expected
    to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational
    assets, or individuals. A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the
    loss of confidentiality might: (i) cause a significant degradation in mission
    capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform
    its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is significantly
    reduced; (ii) result in significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result
    in significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals
    that does not involve loss of life or serious life threatening injuries. (NIST SP 800-60 Vol 1 Rev 1){% endif %}

    {% if information_types_confidentiality_provisional == "High" %}
    The potential impact is high if the loss of confidentiality could be expected
    to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations,
    organizational assets, or individuals. A severe or catastrophic adverse effect
    means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality might: (i) cause a severe
    degradation in or loss of mission capability to an extent and duration that the
    organization is not able to perform one or more of its primary functions; (ii)
    result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in major financial
    loss; or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss
    of life or serious life threatening injuries. (NIST SP 800-60 Vol 1 Rev 1){% endif %}

    that level based on the specifics of your information system.

    Ask yourself:

    {# NIST 800-60 Vol 1 #}

    * How can a malicious adversary use the unauthorized disclosure of information to
    do limited, serious, or severe harm to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals?

    * How can a malicious adversary use the unauthorized disclosure of information to
    gain control of agency assets that might result in unauthorized modification of
    information, destruction of information, or denial of system services that would
    result in limited, serious, or severe harm to agency operations, agency assets,
    or individuals?

    * Would unauthorized disclosure/dissemination of elements of the information type
    violate laws, executive orders, or agency regulations?

    Is **{{information_types_confidentiality_provisional}}** the correct impact level for
    the **confidentiality** of the information contained in the system?

    ## Corrective Action (C.2.1.1)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Corrective Action information
    is **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    corrective action information on the ability of responsible agencies to remedy
    internal or external programs that have been found non-compliant with a given
    law, regulation, or policy. Unauthorized disclosure of most corrective action
    information should have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets,
    or individuals. 11 The confidentiality impact assigned to the Information Management
    Information Type may necessitate the highest confidentiality impact of the information
    types processed by the system. 12 A national security system is any information
    system (including any telecommunications system) used or operated by an agency
    or by a contractor on behalf of an agency, or any other organization on behalf
    of an agency – (i) the function, operation, or use of which: involves intelligence
    activities; involves cryptologic activities related to national security; involves
    command and control of military forces; involves equipment that is an integral
    part of a weapon or weapon system; or is critical to the direct fulfillment of
    military or intelligence missions (excluding a routine administrative or business
    applications system used for applications such as payroll, finance, logistics,
    and personnel management); or (ii) that processes classified information.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where more sensitive information is involved, it will probably be personal information
    subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 or information that is proprietary to a corporation
    or other organization. Such information will often be assigned a moderate confidentiality
    impact level. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented
    in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Additionally, there
    are legislative mandates prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets.
    Trade secrets will generally be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level.

    ## Program Evaluation (C.2.1.2)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Program Evaluation information
    is **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    program evaluation information on the abilities of responsible agencies to analyze
    internal and external program effectiveness and to determine appropriate corrective
    actions. The confidentiality impact of program evaluation information is largely
    event-driven. Once the evaluation has been reported, most program evaluation information
    is in the public domain. However, premature unauthorized disclosure of program
    evaluation information can alert personnel associated with programs under evaluation
    to the focus and preliminary findings of investigative and evaluation activities.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where a major programs or human safety is at stake, actions taken based on unauthorized
    disclosure of program evaluation information can pose a threat to human life or
    a loss of major assets. In such cases, the confidentiality impact is high. Unauthorized
    disclosure of most program evaluation information often has the potential to seriously
    affect agency operations. Also, some program evaluation information, particularly
    in the case of current investigations, includes personal information subject to
    the Privacy Act of 1974 and/or information that is proprietary to a corporation
    or other organization. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are
    documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Additionally,
    there are legislative mandates prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets.
    Trade secrets will generally be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level.
    If the program evaluation information is moved to the public domain, the confidentiality
    impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).

    {% if "C.2.1.3" in information_types %}


    ## Program Monitoring (C.2.1.3)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Program Monitoring information
    is **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    program monitoring information on the ability of responsible agencies to perform
    data-gathering activities required to determine the effectiveness of internal
    and external programs and the extent to which they comply with related laws, regulations,
    and policies.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > There are legislative mandates prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade
    secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact
    level. Note that national security information and national security systems are
    outside the scope of this guideline. Otherwise, where the data being collected
    belongs to one of the information types described in this guideline, the confidentiality
    impact assigned the data and system is that of the highest impact information
    type collected. Unauthorized disclosure of program monitoring information can
    alert personnel associated with programs being monitored to the focus and implications
    of monitoring activities. Where a major programs or human safety is at stake,
    actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of program monitoring information
    can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets. In such cases, the
    confidentiality impact is high. If the program monitoring information is moved
    to the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable
    (NA).

    ## Policy and Guidance Development (C.2.2.1)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Policy and Guidance Development
    information is **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    policy and guidance information on the ability of responsible agencies to create
    and disseminate guidelines to assist in the interpretation and implementation
    of regulations. The confidentiality impact of policy and guidance information
    is largely event-driven. Once a policy or guidance statement has been promulgated,
    most policy and guidance information is in the public domain. However, premature
    unauthorized disclosure of candidate policy and guidance material can result in
    disruption of (and inappropriate influence of special interests on) the policy
    development process.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > The effects of loss of confidentiality of guidelines during the formative stage
    can result in attempts by affected entities and other interested parties to influence
    and/or impede the policy and guideline development process. Premature public release
    of formative policies and guidelines before internal coordination and review can
    result in unnecessary damage to public confidence in the agency. This is particularly
    likely where the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion.
    Delays can impair an agency’s mission, but loss of public confidence can do serious
    and persistent harm to an agency’s ability to effectively perform its mission.
    In such cases, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for policy
    and guidance development information is moderate. When the policy and guidance
    information is in the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes
    Not Applicable (NA).


    {% endif %}

    {% if "C.2.2.2" in information_types %}


    ## Public Comment Tracking (C.2.2.2)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Public Comment Tracking information
    is **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    public comment tracking information on the ability of responsible agencies to
    solicit, maintain, and respond to public comments regarding proposed regulations.
    The effects of loss of confidentiality of information associated with the public
    comment process are unlikely to pose the threat of serious harm to agency assets,
    personnel or operations. In a few cases, the rationale for public comments can
    include information that is sensitive in terms of proprietary information sensitive
    Federal government information, or even national security information. However,
    such cases are exceptional and the information in question would be expected to
    be representative of information types covered elsewhere in this guideline.

    ## Regulatory Creation (C.2.2.3)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Regulatory Creation information
    is **Low**:


    > The level of confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure
    of regulatory creation information on the ability of responsible agencies to research
    and draft proposed and final regulations. The effects of loss of confidentiality
    of early drafts of regulations can result in attempts by affected entities and
    other affected parties to influence and/or impede the regulation development process.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Premature public release of draft regulations before internal coordination and
    review has been conducted can result in unnecessary criticism of the proposed
    regulation and even damage public confidence in the agency. In such cases, the
    provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for regulatory creation information
    is moderate. These consequences are particularly likely where the release includes
    unedited internal commentary and discussion. Delays can impair an agency’s mission,
    but loss of public confidence can do serious and persistent harm to an agency’s
    ability to effectively perform its mission. If the regulatory information is moved
    to the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable
    (NA).

    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Rule Publication information is
    **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    rule publication information on the ability of responsible agencies to publish
    proposed or final rules in the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations.
    The published rules are, by definition, public information. The effects of loss
    of confidentiality of information associated with the rule publication process
    are unlikely to pose the threat of serious harm to agency assets, personnel or
    operations.

    ## Budget Formulation (C.2.3.1)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Budget Formulation information
    is **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    budget formulation information on the ability of responsible agencies to determine
    priorities for future spending and to develop an itemized forecast of future funding
    and expenditures during a targeted period of time. Most budget information is
    supposed to be available to the public.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Some budget information of is classified national security information and is
    outside the scope of this guideline. The effects of loss of confidentiality of
    budget information or of early drafts of budgets can result in attempts by competing
    interests to influence and/or impede the regulation development process. The consequences
    to agency programs and even of the ability of an agency to perform its mission
    can be very serious. Premature public release of draft budgets before internal
    coordination and review has been conducted can result in unnecessary criticism
    of the proposed regulation and even damage public confidence in the agency. These
    consequences are particularly likely where the release includes unedited internal
    commentary and discussion. Delays that result from confidentiality compromise
    can imperil specific agency programs, but loss of public confidence can do persistent
    harm to an agency’s ability to effectively perform its mission. In such cases,
    the confidentiality impact level for budget formulation information is moderate.
    If the budget formulation information is moved to the public domain, the confidentiality
    impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).

    ## Capital Planning (C.2.3.2)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Capital Planning information is
    **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    capital planning information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure
    that appropriate investments are selected for capital expenditures. The effects
    of loss of confidentiality of capital investment plans during the formative stage
    can result in attempts by affected entities and other interested parties to influence
    and/or impede the policy and guideline development process. Premature public release
    of draft plans before internal coordination and review can result in unnecessary
    damage to public confidence in the agency. This is particularly likely where the
    release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. The diversion of
    investment funds that can result from compromise of draft plans can pervert investment
    priorities in a manner that is prejudicial to public interest. However, the consequence
    of loss of confidentiality of most capital planning information is likely to do
    only limited harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of some of the background information that supports
    development of capital investment plans can reveal sensitive vulnerabilities,
    capabilities, or methods of anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security
    activities. Depending on the information in question, the confidentiality impact
    can be moderate, high, or involve national security information (outside the scope
    of this guideline). Also, some capital investment plans of some Federal agencies

    enterprise architecture information on the ability of responsible agencies to
    describe the current state and define the target state and transition strategy
    for an organizations people, processes, and technology. The effects of loss of
    confidentiality of preliminary draft enterprise architecture plans can result
    in attempts by affected entities and other interested parties to influence and/or
    impede the policy and guideline development process. Premature public release
    of draft plans before internal coordination and review can result in unnecessary
    damage to public confidence in the agency. This is particularly likely where the
    release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. However, the consequence
    of loss of confidentiality of most enterprise architecture information is likely

    disclosure of the entire plan to malicious entities may have serious effects.
    As a result, the consequence of loss of confidentiality of comprehensive contingency
    plans is likely to involve serious harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.
    In such cases, the confidentiality impact would be, at least, moderate.

    ## Continuity of Operations (C.2.4.2)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Continuity of Operations information
    is **Moderate**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    continuity of operations information on the ability of responsible agencies to
    identify critical systems and processes, and to conduct the planning and preparation
    required to ensure that these systems and processes will be available in the event
    of a catastrophic event. Unauthorized disclosure of the entire plan to malicious
    entities may have serious effects. As a result, the consequence of loss of confidentiality
    of most continuity of operations plans (and comprehensive continuity of operations
    plans) is likely to do serious harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of background information that supports development
    of Federal continuity of operations plans can reveal sensitive vulnerabilities,
    capabilities, intelligence assessments, intelligence sources, or methods employed
    in anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security activities. Depending
    on the information in question, the confidentiality impact can be moderate, high,
    or involve national security information (outside the scope of this guideline).
    Unauthorized disclosure of continuity of operations information for critical infrastructures
    and key national assets may require a high impact level. However, the purpose
    of most continuity of operations information is to protect against inadvertent
    or accidental damaging events rather than against malicious attacks. Even so,
    in the case of Federal government systems, hostile attacks on systems must be
    considered. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of extracts from continuity
    of operations plans are likely to have negligible to limited adverse effects on
    agency operations. In such cases, the confidentiality impact would be, at most,
    low. Unauthorized disclosure of continuity of operations information may inform
    an adversary regarding what facilities and processes are considered to be critical.
    Such unauthorized disclosure may also equip an adversary with the information
    necessary to attack a system so that operations are disrupted, and that recovery
    is impaired. In such cases, the confidentiality impact would be, at least, moderate.

    ## Service Recovery (C.2.4.3)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Service Recovery information is
    **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of the unauthorized disclosure
    of service recovery information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop
    plans for resuming operations after a catastrophe occurs, such as a fire or earthquake.
    In the case of service recovery plans for natural catastrophes, the information
    associated with service recovery planning is not intrinsically sensitive. In the
    case of catastrophes caused by malicious activity, unauthorized disclosure of
    service recovery information may inform an adversary regarding what facilities
    and processes are considered to be critical. Such unauthorized disclosure may
    also equip an adversary with the information necessary to attack a system in such
    a way that operations are disrupted, and that recovery is impaired or even blocked.
    The purpose of most service recovery information is to protect against natural
    catastrophes rather than against malicious attacks. In most cases, the consequence
    of loss of confidentiality of service recovery information is not likely to do
    serious harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of background information that supports development
    of Federal service recovery plans can reveal sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities,
    intelligence assessments, intelligence sources, or methods employed in anti-terrorism,
    law enforcement, or national security activities. Depending on the information
    in question, the confidentiality impact can be moderate, high, or involve national
    security information (outside the scope of this guideline). Also, some service
    recovery plans are themselves national security information.

    ## Debt Collection (C.2.5.1)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Debt Collection information is
    **Moderate**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    debt collection information on the ability of responsible agencies to properly
    and efficiently collect money owed to the United States government from both foreign
    and domestic sources. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of debt collection
    information are generally dependent on the identity of the debtor and of the nature
    and value of the debt being collected. Typically, unauthorized disclosure of debt
    collection information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
    assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where more sensitive information is involved, it will commonly be personal information
    subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, information that is proprietary to a corporation
    or other organization, or information that is politically sensitive by a foreign
    government. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented
    in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Such information
    will often be associated with debt collection processes. Where the amount of the
    debt is significant, and unauthorized knowledge might imperil successful collection,
    then the associated confidentiality impact assigned to debt collection information
    might be moderate (or even high in the case of extremely high dollar value cases).

    and efficiently enforce, regulate, and effect the collection of fees assessed
    on individuals or organizations for the provision of Government services and for
    the use of Government goods or resources. In general, particularly in aggregate,

    of Federal asset sales information on the ability of responsible agencies to properly
    and efficiently acquire, oversee, track, and sell non-internal assets managed
    by the Federal Government with a commercial value and sold to the private sector.
    The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of Federal asset sales information
    are generally dependent on the nature and value of the property being disposed.
    Generally, Federal asset sales information is public. Most managed property would
    not be of sufficient individual value to occasion such an occurrence (bid rigging,
    etc.).


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where unauthorized knowledge regarding the property being disposed of might
    lead to unfair advantage (i.e., ability to accurately bid on an auction lot to
    the detriment of other bidders), then the associated confidentiality impact assigned
    to Federal asset sales information might be moderate. Such an instance might arise
    if a disruption of the proper procedures could reasonably cause an adverse effect
    on future operations of the responsible agency, or if the agency’s image, or individual
    reputations might be damaged.

    customer service information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide
    and manage the delivery of information and support to the government’s customers.
    Most customer service information is likely to be in the public domain and poses
    no confidentiality impact. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of customer
    service information will have at most a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
    assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Some customer service information may include customer-provided information
    covered by the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act Information
    provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication
    information type. Unauthorized disclosure of large volumes of information protected
    under the Privacy Act can be expected to have a serious to severe effect on public
    confidence in the agency. Actions taken that are intended to establish blame,
    compensate victims, or repair damage done with the exposed information can cause
    serious disruption of an agency’s mission capability. In such cases, the confidentiality
    impact can be moderate.

    public relations information on the ability of responsible agencies to promote
    an organizations image through the effective handling of citizen concerns. Public
    relations information itself is usually in the public domain and poses no confidentiality
    impact.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Internal correspondence associated with development of public relations information

    legislation from conception to adoption. Legislation tracking information itself
    is usually in the public domain and poses no confidentiality impact.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > In some cases, internal correspondence associated with legislation tracking
    information can contain information, that if improperly disclosed, will have a
    serious adverse effect on agency relationships with other agencies and with the
    legislative branch. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to
    such information.

    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    legislation testimony information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide
    testimony/evidence in support or, or opposition to, legislation from conception
    to adoption. Most testimony regarding legislation is in the public domain, and
    even premature release should result in no more than limited harm to agency assets,
    personnel, or operations.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > The effects of loss of confidentiality of some information applicable to pending
    testimony may result in attempts by competing interests to influence and/or impede
    a specific legislative process. The consequences to agency programs and of the
    ability of an agency to perform its mission can be very serious. Premature public
    release of draft testimony before internal coordination and review has been conducted
    can result in unnecessary criticism of the proposed testimony and damage public
    confidence in the agency. These consequences are particularly likely where the
    release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. The results of unauthorized
    disclosure of information to the public can imperil specific agency programs,
    but a consequent loss of public confidence can do persistent harm to an agency’s
    ability to effectively perform its mission. This can result in assignment of a
    moderate impact level to such information. Some information associated with legislative
    testimony is classified national security information and is outside the scope

    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    proposal development information on the ability of responsible agencies to draft
    proposed legislation that creates or amends laws subject to Congressional legislative
    action. Legislation is normally in the public domain. However, the effects of
    loss of confidentiality of background information used in the development of proposed
    legislation or of early drafts of proposed legislation could result in attempts
    by competing interests to influence and/or impede a specific legislative process.
    The consequences to agency programs and of the ability of an agency to perform
    its mission can be very serious. Premature public release of proposed legislation
    before internal coordination and review has been conducted can result in unnecessary
    criticism of the proposed legislation and even damage public confidence in the
    agency. These consequences are particularly likely where the release includes
    unedited internal commentary and discussion. In general, unauthorized disclosure
    of much legislative proposal information, particularly in early phases of the
    process, is likely to result in serious harm to agency assets or operations.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Some proposal development information used by specific Federal agencies (e.g.,
    homeland security, law enforcement, defense, intelligence community) is very sensitive
    or classified national security information. National security information is
    outside the scope of this guideline. The sensitivity level recommended for the
    very sensitive information is high. If the proposal development information is

    information is **Moderate**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    Congressional liaison information on the ability of responsible agencies to support
    their formal relationships with U.S. Congress. The effects of loss of confidentiality
    of information associated with Congressional liaison can facilitate attempts by
    competing interests to influence and/or impede a specific legislative process
    or poison inter-branch relations. The consequences to agency programs and even
    of the ability of an agency to perform its mission can be very serious. Premature
    public release of information associated with Congressional liaison before internal
    coordination and review has been conducted can result in unnecessary criticism
    of the preliminary data or positions, and even damage public confidence in the
    agency. These consequences are particularly likely where the release includes
    unedited internal commentary and discussion. In general, unauthorized disclosure
    of much Congressional liaison information is likely to result in serious harm
    to agency assets and/or operations. If the Congressional liaison information is
    moved to the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable

    of Treasury performs on behalf of the Government. The effects of loss of confidentiality
    can reasonably be expected to jeopardize relationships and administrative actions
    necessary to mission fulfillment and/or to seriously damage public confidence
    in the agency. For example, the unauthorized disclosure of investigative and enforcement
    information can have serious economic impact on both individual companies and
    the broader market place (e.g., short-term stock market perturbations). The consequences
    of such unauthorized disclosures may have a serious adverse effect on public confidence
    in the agency.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where the operations in question involve liaison with law enforcement or homeland
    security organizations, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure can imperil
    operations critical to the security of human life, critical infrastructure protection,
    ore the protection of key national assets. For those operations, the consequences

    central property management information on the ability of the General Services
    Administration to acquire, provide, and centrally administer offices buildings,
    fleets, machinery, and other capital assets and consumable supplies used by the
    Federal government. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most central
    property management information are likely to have only a limited adverse effect
    on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of information associated with very large procurements
    can result in fraud, waste, abuse, and/or legal proceedings that can have a serious
    to severe effect on Federal government assets and operations. Also, information
    associated with acquisition, maintenance, administration, and operation of many
    Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational facilities
    can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities
    to facilitate or perpetrate fraud, theft, or some other criminal enterprise. In
    this case, unauthorized disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect
    on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. The consequent confidentiality
    impact would be at least moderate. Information associated with maintenance, administration,
    and operation of other Federal government facilities can be of material use to
    terrorists seeking to penetrate and/or commandeer such facilities as part of operations
    intended to harm critical infrastructures, key national assets, or people. Examples
    of more potentially damaging information include architectural, maintenance and
    administrative information that might permit either covert pedestrian or unimpeded
    vehicular access to government buildings (e.g., Congressional office buildings,
    FBI Headquarters, the National Archives, Smithsonian Institution buildings, dams,
    nuclear power plants, etc.). In such cases, the confidentiality impact level may
    be high. [Some information is classified as national security and is outside the
    scope of this guideline.] Anticipated or realized unauthorized disclosure of one
    agency’s central property management information by GSA could result in negative

    human resources management and consulting services, education and leadership development
    services, and investigation services. The unauthorized disclosure of most central
    personnel management information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
    operations, assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Very sensitive information is typically personal information subject to the
    Privacy Act of 1974. (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are

    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    taxation management information on the ability of the Internal Revenue Service
    (IRS) to enforce the Internal Revenue Code and to collect taxes in the United
    States and abroad. The IRS Guidebook for Information Sensitivity Analysis provides
    guidelines for identifying IRS Official Use Only (OUO) Information. Sensitive
    information is identified in the IRM as any information which if lost, stolen,
    (accessed), or altered without proper authorization may adversely affect Service
    operations. The IRM states that unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information
    may cause lawsuits against Service officials as well as the Service, unwanted
    notoriety for the Service, and public distrust of the Service’s ability to protect
    such information – all of which may result in an increase in noncompliance with
    tax laws. It notes that unauthorized release of information such as the name and
    address of an informant (in cases of tax evasion or fraud) may threaten a person’s
    life. 17 Additionally, sensitive information is defined in Section 25.10 of the
    IRM as information that requires protection due to the risk or magnitude of loss
    that could result from inadvertent or deliberate disclosure of the information.
    Sensitive information includes information whose improper use could adversely
    affect the ability of the agency to accomplish its mission, proprietary information,
    records about individuals that require protection under the Privacy Act, and information
    not releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. The IRS OUO guideline notes
    that prevention of unauthorized disclosure of information revealing internal matters,
    the disclosure of which would risk circumvention of a legal requirement or agency
    rules and regulations has assumed an increasingly important role in homeland security.
    Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or private IRS information can be expected
    to have a serious effect on both the welfare of individuals and public confidence
    in the government.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > In cases where unauthorized disclosure of taxation information can impede anti-terrorism
    or other homeland security activities or endanger the lives of agents or informants,
    the confidentiality impact level is high.

    of personal and government information. (The provisional impact levels for personnel
    information are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication, Income,
    Representative Payee, and Entitlement Event information types.)


    Examples why you may need to change the level:

    and other source information for benefits determination and revenue collection
    operations is likely to violate the Privacy Act of 1974 and other regulations
    applicable to the dissemination of personal and government information. Unauthorized
    disclosure of centrally managed income information can have a serious adverse

    of personal identity and authentication information on the ability of Federal
    agencies to determine that communications with and payments to individuals are
    being made with or to the correct individuals - and to protect individuals against
    identity theft and the Federal government against fraud. Unauthorized disclosure
    of raw data and other source information for identity authentication operations
    is likely to violate the Privacy Act of 1974 and other regulations applicable
    to the dissemination of personal and government information. There are many cases
    in which unauthorized disclosure of personal identity and authentication information
    will have only a limited adverse effect on government operations, assets, or individuals.
    However, the potential for use of such information by criminals to perpetrate
    identity theft and related fraud can do serious harm to individuals. Unauthorized
    disclosure of centrally managed personal identity and authentication information,
    such as passport and visa control databases can have a serious adverse effect
    on agency missions.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > For agencies that manage large income information involving records of the general
    public, the provisional confidentiality impact level can be expected to be at
    least moderate. Where personal identity and authentication information is used
    in controlling access to facilities (e.g., Federal facilities, critical infrastructure
    facilities, key national assets) or for border control purposes, the consequences
    of unauthorized disclosure that permits credentials forgery can justify a high

    of raw data and other source information for entitlement operations is likely
    to violate the Privacy Act of 1974 and other regulations applicable to the dissemination
    of personal information. Unauthorized disclosure of centrally managed entitlement
    event information can have a serious adverse effect on agency missions. Therefore

    information is **Moderate**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure
    of representative payee information on the ability of the Federal government to
    determine that entitlement funds are being used appropriately for the well being
    of entitled individuals - and to protect individuals against identity theft and
    the Federal government against fraud. Unauthorized disclosure of data for representative
    payee operations is likely to violate the Privacy Act of 1974 and other regulations
    applicable to the dissemination of personal information. Unauthorized disclosure
    of centrally managed representative payee information can have a serious adverse
    effect on agency missions and on large numbers of individuals. Therefore, in the
    case of large representative payee information databases, the provisional confidentiality
    impact level can be expected to be at least moderate.

    ## Facilities, Fleet, and Equipment Management (C.3.1.1)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Facilities, Fleet, and Equipment
    Management information is **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    facilities, fleet, and equipment management information on the ability of responsible
    agencies to maintain, administer, and operate offices buildings, fleets, machinery,
    and other capital assets of the Federal government. The consequences of unauthorized
    disclosure of most facilities, fleet, and equipment management information are
    likely to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
    or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Information associated with maintenance, administration, and operation of many
    Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational facilities
    can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities
    in order to facilitate or perpetrate fraud, theft, or some other criminal enterprise
    (e.g., extract inmates from Federal detention facilities). In this case, unauthorized
    disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations,
    agency assets, or individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact would be
    at least moderate. Information associated with maintenance, administration, and
    operation of other Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets,
    and operational facilities can be of material use to terrorists seeking to penetrate
    and/or commandeer such facilities as part of operations intended to harm critical
    infrastructures, key national assets, or people. Examples of this information
    include information that reveals specific measures respecting limiting access
    to and operation of government aircraft, maintenance and administrative information
    that might permit either covert pedestrian or unimpeded vehicular access to government
    buildings (e.g., Congressional office buildings, FBI Headquarters, the National
    Archives, Smithsonian Institution buildings, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.),
    and schedules/itineraries of government surface transportation fleets (e.g., for
    transport of executive personnel or hazardous materials). In these cases, the
    confidentiality impact must be considered to be high. [Some information regarding
    transportation and storage of nuclear materials is classified as national security
    related and is outside the scope of this guideline. Other information, such as
    Nuclear Regulatory Commission “SAFEGUARDS” information is not national security
    information, but must have a high confidentiality impact level.] Anticipated or
    realized unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s facilities, fleet, and equipment
    management information by another agency could result in negative impacts on crossjurisdictional
    coordination within the facilities, fleet, and equipment management infrastructure
    and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with facilities, fleet,
    and/or equipment management.

    help desk service information on the ability of responsible agencies to manage
    of service center responses to government employees' technical and administrative
    questions. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most help desk service
    information are likely to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
    agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Information associated with service center responses can provide useful information
    to adversaries seeking to penetrate Federal systems. If the contents or functions
    of a system have sufficient sensitivity and/or criticality, a moderate or high
    impact level may be considered for help desk information.

    ## Security Management (C.3.1.3)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Security Management information
    is **Moderate**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    security management information on the ability of responsible organizations to
    physically protect their personnel, assets, and facilities. The consequences of
    unauthorized disclosure of most security management information depend on the
    likelihood that the information might jeopardize the physical security of an organization’s
    assets and the value, and potential for damage of the assets being protected.
    Information associated with the physical security of many Federal government office
    buildings, transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material
    use to criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities in order to perpetrate
    a major crime (e.g., extraction of inmates from Federal detention facilities,
    theft of commodities market projections, access to information associated with
    a felony criminal investigation or prosecution, theft of blank license issuing
    facilities and/or materials, access to competition-sensitive information associated
    with major procurements, undetected access to national archives or museum properties,
    access to currency printing facilities or materials, theft of major currency or
    bullion storage facilities). In such cases, unauthorized disclosure of information
    can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
    Unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s security management information by another
    agency could result in negative impacts on crossjurisdictional coordination within
    the security management infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations
    tasked with physical protection of Federal facilities. The consequences of physical
    protection failures at most Federal facilities are more likely to result in serious
    21 adverse effects.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Information associated with security management at other Federal government
    office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of
    material use to terrorists seeking to penetrate and/or commandeer such facilities
    as part of operations intended to harm critical infrastructures, key national
    assets, or people. Examples of more potentially damaging information includes
    information that reveals specific measures for protecting government aircraft,
    information that might permit access that creates an opportunity to bomb a government
    building (e.g., Congressional office buildings, FBI Headquarters, the National
    Archives, Smithsonian Institution buildings, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.),
    and leadership protection details that could result in assassination opportunities.
    In these cases, the confidentiality impact must be high. Unauthorized disclosure
    of security management information that can be reasonably expected to pose a serious
    threat to human life (including those of security guards) must also be assigned
    a high confidentiality impact. [Security management information associated with
    some Federal government assets is classified. The classified information is national
    security related and is 21 A loss of confidentiality that causes a significant
    degradation in mission capability, places the agency at a significant disadvantage,
    or results in major damage to assets, requiring extensive corrective actions or
    repairs. outside the scope of this guideline.] Other security management information,
    such as that affecting Nuclear Regulatory Commission “SAFEGUARDS” or Internal
    Revenue Service “Limited For Official Use Only” information is not national security
    information, but must be treated as having high confidentiality impact.

    ## Travel (C.3.1.4)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Travel information is **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    travel information on the abilities of responsible agencies to plan, prepare,
    and monitor business related travel for the organization’s employees. Generally,
    the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the majority of travel information
    will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
    individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of employee identification information coupled with
    credit information (e.g., name, social security number, credit card number) can
    result in moderate to serious consequences for individuals and local organizations.
    The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal
    Identity and Authentication information type. Unauthorized disclosure of information
    concerning carrier/provider contract negotiations can have significant financial
    or legal consequences and put an agency at a serious disadvantage. Also, severe
    consequences may result from unauthorized disclosure of information regarding
    leadership travel plans that might jeopardize personnel security or the confidentiality
    of sensitive operations plans. In the most sensitive cases, the confidentiality
    impact level may be high.

    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    assets and liability management information on the ability of responsible agencies
    to provide accounting support for the management of assets and liabilities of
    the Federal government. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of assets and liability
    management information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
    assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of some asset and liability management information for
    programs that process high-impact information can assist some criminals to evade
    enforcement activities. Examples range from tax evasion resulting from unauthorized
    disclosure of information regarding audit budgets to unauthorized disclosure of
    budget details for specific border control, antiterrorism, or witness protection
    expenditures. Where actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of assets and

    effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of financial reporting information for programs that
    process high-impact information can give adversaries damaging insights into details
    of agency plans, priorities, and operations. In relatively rare cases, actions

    and programs, budgets, and performance outputs and outcomes; and to finance Federal
    programs and operations through appropriation and apportionment of direct and
    reimbursable spending authority, fund transfers, investments and other financing
    mechanisms. In general, unauthorized disclosure of funds control information,
    particularly of budget allocations for specific programs or program elements,
    can be seriously detrimental to government interests in procurement processes.
    In many instances, such unauthorized disclosure is prohibited by executive order
    or by law (e.g., Federal Acquisition Regulation). Premature release of draft funds
    control information can yield advantages to competing interests and seriously
    endanger agency operations – or even agency mission.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of funds control information for programs that process
    classified or high-impact information can give adversaries damaging insights into
    details of agency plans, priorities, and operations. (Classified programs and
    systems are outside the scope of this guideline.) In rare cases, actions taken

    funds and expenditure of Federal appropriations in accordance with applicable
    Federal standards. Unauthorized disclosure of accounting information for programs
    that process classified or high-impact information can give adversaries damaging
    insights into details of agency plans, priorities, and operations. In most cases,
    unauthorized disclosure of accounting information will have only a limited adverse
    effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. (Classified programs and
    systems are outside the scope of this guideline.)


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > In relatively rare cases, actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of
    accounting details can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets,
    so the confidentiality impact would be high. In some cases, unauthorized disclosure
    of accounting information can violate proprietary information or other non-disclosure
    agreements. In such cases, the government may suffer not only a loss of public
    confidence, but may become vulnerable to legal actions. Where sensitive or proprietary
    information is involved, the impact of unauthorized disclosure is likely to be
    moderate. Where the accounting information is involved in an audit associated

    effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Payment information typically includes information needed for electronic payments
    such as bank account numbers. Unauthorized access to this type of information
    could result in significant financial loss for both the Federal government and
    its payees. Where payment activities are part of an agency’s service delivery
    mission (e.g., payment of benefits), Privacy Act information and other information

    ## Goods Acquisition (C.3.4.1)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Goods Acquisition information
    is **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    goods acquisition information on the ability of agencies to procure physical goods,
    products, and capital assets to be used by the Federal government. The consequences
    of unauthorized disclosure of most goods acquisition information will have only
    a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of information associated with large procurements can
    result in fraud, waste, abuse, and/or legal proceedings that can have a serious
    to severe effect on Federal government assets and operations. Also, information
    associated with acquisition of many Federal government facilities can be useful
    to criminals seeking to gain access to those facilities. In these cases, unauthorized
    disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations,
    agency assets, or individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact would range
    from moderate to high. Also, unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s goods acquisition
    information by another agency could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional
    coordination within the goods acquisition infrastructure and the general effectiveness
    of organizations tasked with acquisition of government facilities and supplies.
    Additionally, some procurement information associated with proposals is proprietary.
    In the case of competitive procurements, much information associated with unsuccessful
    bids remains proprietary following award of the contract (e.g., pricing information).
    Unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information can have serious consequences
    for agencies and have at least a moderate confidentiality impact level. Some procurement
    information is classified. The classified information is national security related
    and is outside the scope of this guideline.

    inventory control information on the ability of agencies to track information
    related to procured assets and resources with regards to quantity, quality, and
    location. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most inventory control
    information are likely to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
    agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of information associated with inventories of hazardous
    materials (e.g., radioactive materials, toxins, bio-hazardous items, explosives)
    can facilitate terrorist or other criminal activities that may result in serious
    effects on Federal government assets and operations and on the general public.
    In general, inventory control information can be of material use to criminals
    seeking to perpetrate fraud, theft, or some other criminal enterprise. In these
    cases too, unauthorized disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect
    on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. The consequent confidentiality
    impact of these types of criminal exploitation of unauthorized disclosure of inventory
    control information would range from moderate to high. Also, unauthorized disclosure
    of one agency’s inventory control information by another agency could result in
    negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the inventory control
    infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with the
    distribution and accounting of government facilities and supplies. Some inventory
    control information is classified. The classified information is national security

    logistics management information on the ability of agencies to plan and track
    the availability and location of personnel and their resources. The consequences
    of unauthorized disclosure of most logistics management information are likely
    to have only limited adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of logistics information associated with homeland security,
    law enforcement and some transportation activities (e.g., air transport) can facilitate
    terrorist or other criminal activities that may result in serious on Federal government
    assets and operations and on the general public. Logistics management information
    associated with a broad range of mission areas can be of material use to criminals
    seeking to perpetrate fraud, theft, or other criminal enterprises. Also, this
    information is a key intelligence target for those seeking information on defense
    or law enforcement capabilities, dispositions and intent. In all these cases,
    the unauthorized disclosure of logistics management information may result in
    serious adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets, and individuals.
    Therefore, the confidentiality impact level for these types of criminal exploitation
    of unauthorized disclosure of logistics management information will range from
    moderate to high. Some logistics management information is classified (e.g., some
    military logistics information). The classified information is national security
    related and is outside the scope of this guideline.

    manage contractors and service providers from the private sector. The consequences
    of unauthorized disclosure of most services acquisition information are likely
    to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
    individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of information associated with very large procurements
    can result in fraud, waste, abuse, and/or legal proceedings that can have a serious
    effect on Federal government assets and operations. Also, information associated
    with acquisition of some services (e.g., security or protection services) can
    be of material use to criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities or
    information in order to facilitate or perpetrate sabotage, murder, fraud, theft,
    or other criminal enterprises. In these cases, unauthorized disclosure of information
    can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, and/or
    individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact will range from moderate to
    high. Additionally, some procurement information associated with proposals is
    proprietary. In the case of competitive procurements, much information associated
    with unsuccessful bids remains proprietary following award of the contract (e.g.,
    pricing information). Unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information can have
    serious consequences for agencies and have at least a moderate confidentiality

    to execute processes that facilitate a smooth evolution, composition, and workforce
    transition of the design and implementation of changes to agency resources such
    as assets, methodologies, systems, or procedures.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of some lifecycle/change management information can
    provide adversaries with intelligence information that may be useful in efforts
    to compromise the system. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level
    to such information. Additionally, there are legislative mandates prohibiting
    unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned
    a moderate confidentiality impact level.

    IT infrastructure maintenance information on the ability of responsible agencies
    to plan, design, implement, and maintain an IT Infrastructure to effectively support
    automated needs (i.e. operating systems, applications software, platforms, networks,
    servers, printers, etc.). [See also Appendices C.3.5.5, IT Security Information
    and C.3.5.7, Information Management Information.] IT infrastructure maintenance
    also includes information systems configuration and security policy enforcement
    information. Unauthorized disclosure of some IT infrastructure maintenance information
    can lead to confidentiality compromise of information processed by the system
    (e.g., password files, file access tables, cryptographic keying information, network
    access rules, and hardware and software configuration settings, and documentation
    that may affect access to the information system’s data, programs, and/or processes).
    As a result, the confidentiality impact associated with this information is that
    of the highest impact information processed by the system. Also, a higher confidentiality
    impact may be associated with information in aggregate than is associated with
    any single element of information.

    IT security information on the ability of responsible agencies to secure Federal
    data and systems through the creation and definition of security policies, procedures
    and controls covering such services as identification, authentication, and non-repudiation.
    In most cases, the security policy, procedures, and available controls are not
    particularly sensitive. Typically, the security information is used in initializing
    and implementing the controls (e.g., passwords, cryptographic keys) that need
    to be protected. In general, disclosure of the security policies, procedures,

    track, account for, maintain, retrieve, and disseminate official documents and
    records. When the data being retained belongs to one of the information types
    described in this guideline, the confidentiality impact assigned the data and
    system is at least that of the highest impact information type collected. Typically,
    the unauthorized disclosure of most business management information retained will
    have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.
    National security information and national security systems are outside the scope
    of this guideline.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where more sensitive information is involved, it will most commonly be personal
    information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 or information that is proprietary
    to a corporation or other organization. The Privacy Act Information provisional
    impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information
    type. Such information will often be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact
    level. Where any of the information to be collected can reasonably be expected
    to have a high confidentiality impact level, then the record retention system

    the day-to-day processes of information collection, storage, dissemination, and
    destruction and managing the policies, guidelines, and standards regarding information
    management. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure depend largely on the
    content and use of the information being managed. The unauthorized disclosure
    of information management information relevant to most information managed by
    the government will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets,
    or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Information collection and storage involve the day-to-day processes of gathering
    and storing data from agency programs, partners, and stakeholders. More sensitive
    information being managed is usually personal information subject to the Privacy
    Act of 1974 or information that is proprietary to a corporation or other organization.
    The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal
    Identity and Authentication information type. Such information will often be assigned
    a moderate confidentiality impact level Where any of the information to be managed
    can be expected to have a high confidentiality, impact level, then the information
    management information must be assigned a high confidentiality impact level. When
    the data being managed belongs to one of the information types described in this
    guideline, the confidentiality impact assigned to the system is that of the highest
    impact information type processed by the system. Depending on the agency and the
    mission being supported, the sensitivity of the information can range from none

    on the content and use of the monitoring information gathered, retained, and reported.
    The unauthorized disclosure of system and network monitoring containing architectural
    information, vulnerabilities, and availability information may have a serious
    adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where the system and network monitoring information collected can be expected
    to have a high confidentiality impact level, then the system and network monitoring
    information must be assigned a high confidentiality impact level. When the system
    and network monitoring data being collected supports information types described
    in this guideline, agency personnel should consider a confidentiality impact assignment
    of the highest impact information type processed by the system. Depending on the

    border control information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce laws
    regulating the admission of foreign-born persons (i.e., aliens) to the United
    States. Generally, the effects of unauthorized disclosure of border control information
    are usually confined to a single geographic region, immigration case, or deportation
    case. Even so, unauthorized disclosure may have a serious adverse effect on mission
    functions, cause significant degradation in mission capability, or place the agency
    at a significant disadvantage with respect to its border control responsibilities.
    Particularly in the case of immigration, naturalization, and deportation activities,
    unauthorized disclosure of information can violate privacy policies. Such unauthorized
    disclosures can have a serious effect on public confidence in the agency.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where border control information is also associated with other mission information
    types (e.g., criminal apprehension, and criminal investigation and surveillance
    information), the confidentiality impact level associated with the information
    may be high. Where unauthorized disclosure of border control information may put
    the physical safety of personnel into serious jeopardy, the confidentiality impact
    level associated with the information may be high. Unauthorized disclosure of
    confidentiality of information associated with ensuring security of transportation
    and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United
    States can result in facilitation of terrorist activities that endanger human
    life. In some cases, the consequent threat to critical infrastructures, key national
    assets, and human life can be catastrophic. Consequently, the confidentiality
    impact level associated with information associated with ensuring security of
    transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel
    within the United States is normally high.

    > The confidentiality impact level associated with the executive information type
    is associated with functions of the Executive Office of the President (EOP). The
    effects of loss of confidentiality of policies and guidance during the formative
    stage can result in attempts by affected entities and other interested parties
    to influence and/or impede the policy and guidance development process. Premature
    public release of formative policies and guidance before internal coordination
    and review can result in unnecessary damage to public confidence in the EOP. These
    consequences may occur when the release includes unedited internal commentary
    and discussion. Most of the information processed in and by the EOP is classified
    national security information and is outside the scope of this guideline. Other
    information processed by the EOP is extremely sensitive and applicable to homeland
    security and law enforcement. The unauthorized disclosure of this extremely sensitive

    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    disaster monitoring and prediction information on the ability of responsible agencies
    to predict when and where a disaster may take place and communicate that information
    to affected parties. The purpose of disaster monitoring and prediction activities
    is generally to disseminate information. Sharing of raw information by a diverse
    group of analysts often improves the quality of predictive analysis.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of some disaster monitoring and
    prediction information may include public panic or other responses that jeopardize
    public safety, disaster prevention, emergency response, disaster repair, or restoration
    missions. For example, attempts of large populations to evacuate in an endangered
    area before necessary preparations are made for evacuation routes can result in
    a clogging of the routes and failure to evacuate large parts of the population
    in time to save them from a life-threatening event. Most of the disaster monitoring
    and prediction information is critical in terms of potential loss of human life
    and major property damage. The unauthorized release of this information may interfere
    with disaster prevention or emergency response missions. The confidentiality impact
    level recommended for the information cited in the example can be moderate or
    high. The unauthorized disclosure of disaster monitoring and prediction information
    to terrorists may reveal weak or sensitive points to target, the most effective
    technique(s use in attacking a target, and information regarding the status, intent,
    and plans of our adversaries. Where unauthorized disclosure of disaster monitoring

    to develop response programs to be used in case of a disaster. This involves the
    development of emergency management programs and activities as well as staffing
    and equipping regional response centers. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure
    of most disaster preparedness and planning information would have, at most, a
    limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of some disaster preparedness and
    planning information may include revealing weak or sensitive critical infrastructure
    characteristics or inadequate security of U.S. targets to terrorists or other
    adversaries. Such information may reveal to an enemy the most effective technique(s)
    to use in attacking a target, and/or information regarding the capabilities, intent,
    and plans of our adversaries. Where unauthorized disclosure of disaster preparedness
    and planning information associated with critical infrastructures, large groups

    to a disaster. These actions include providing mobile telecommunications, operational
    support, power generation, search and rescue, and medical life saving actions.
    The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of emergency response information
    will usually have little or no adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
    or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > In cases where an attack is underway, unauthorized disclosure of emergency response
    information can provide information that might permit terrorists or other adversaries
    to target emergency response assets, thus jeopardizing emergency response resources
    and missions and public safety. Given the criticality that much emergency response
    information has in terms of potential loss of human life and major property damage,
    where unauthorized release of information can reasonably be expected to facilitate
    interference with emergency response missions, the confidentiality impact level
    may be moderate or high. The unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s emergency
    response by another agency could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional
    coordination within the critical emergency services infrastructure and the general
    effectiveness of organizations tasked with emergency response missions.

    conflict resolution information on the ability of responsible agencies to mitigate
    and prevent disputes stemming from inter and intra-state disagreements. Unauthorized
    disclosure of conflict resolution information can reasonably be expected to jeopardize
    fulfillment of conflict resolution missions. This is particularly true of premature
    release of resolution factors, personnel profiles, and proposed solutions to adversaries.
    Some information that has supported a conflict resolution process may undo the
    results of successful conflict resolution processes. The loss of public confidence
    in the agency may cause a catastrophic adverse effect on an agency’s mission capability.
    Where information includes candid opinions of agency personnel, or involvement
    of agency personnel in specific prior activities, the effectiveness of those personnel
    for many future agency missions may be permanently impaired. The consequences
    of failed conflict resolution activities may pose threats to human life and major
    property assets The level of confidentiality impact assigned to treaties and agreements
    information is determined by the ability of responsible agencies to negotiate
    and implement accords with foreign governments and organizations in efforts related
    to arms reduction and regulation, trade matters, criminal investigations and extraditions,
    and other types of foreign policy. Unauthorized disclosure of information associated
    with treaties and agreements can reasonably be expected to prevent successful
    negotiation and/or ratification of treaties and agreements. This is particularly
    true of prematurely released resolution factors, personality assessments, and
    proposed solutions to adversaries. Some information that has supported a treaty
    or other international agreement process may undo the results of a successfully
    completed treaty or agreement. The subsequent threat to public confidence in the
    agency can cause a catastrophic adverse effect on an agency’s mission capability.
    When the disclosed information includes candid opinions of agency personnel, or
    background information on agency personnel, the effectiveness of those personnel
    for future agency missions may be permanently impaired. The consequences of failure
    to successfully conclude treaties and other international agreements often pose
    threats to human life and major property assets.

    alleviation and food relief, foreign market expansion, and donations, as well
    as the establishment of policies and procedures to facilitate economic development.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > The unauthorized disclosure of international development and humanitarian aid
    information may not directly jeopardize foreign socio-economic and political development
    missions. However, the premature disclosure of this information may adversely
    affect agency credibility or give unfair competitive advantages to some candidates
    for mission support activities. These secondary effects may have a negative effect
    on the intended beneficiaries and can result, in extreme cases, in threats to
    human life, major assets, or the ability of the agency to perform future missions.
    Some information that has supported an international development and humanitarian
    aid process can even undo the results of previously completed foreign socio-economic
    and political development processes. Where there is a possibility of catastrophic
    consequences such as threats to human life and major property assets, a high confidentiality

    worldwide economic prosperity by increasing trade through the opening of overseas
    markets and freeing the flow of goods, services, and capital. Also, the confidentiality
    impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of merchandise inspection
    information on the ability of responsible agencies to accurately determine, report,
    and record the discovered status of imported or exported merchandise as it bears
    on violations of various Customs laws. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure
    of merchandise inspection information will not jeopardize the completion of other
    merchandise inspection missions, as shipment status is generally information of
    public record. The confidentiality impact level is also the effect of unauthorized
    disclosure of tariffs/quotas monitoring information on the ability of responsible
    agencies to enforce various Customs laws, and preserve statistical data concerning
    the historical compliance with such laws. Typically, the unauthorized disclosure
    of tariffs/quotas monitoring information will not jeopardize the completion of
    other tariffs/quotas monitoring missions because the information is publicly available.
    Unauthorized disclosure of information that has supported an export promotion
    process may undo the results of successful export promotion processes. The consequent
    threat to agency image or reputations can cause a catastrophic adverse effect
    on an agency’s mission capability. Consequently, the general confidentiality impact
    level associated with export promotion information is high. Some information that
    has supported a tariffs/quotas monitoring process might be of higher sensitivity,
    such as intelligence information 36 that might point to a dumping situation. The

    or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > There may be some cases for which moderate confidentiality impact is associated
    with unauthorized disclosure of business/industry development. For example, unauthorized
    disclosure of details of current agency water resource management activities and
    plans may focus opposition and/or give an unfair advantage to competing interests.
    Consistent premature disclosure of agency plans may cause significant degradation

    agencies to survey, maintain, and operate public lands and monuments, as well
    as to ensure the preservation of land, water, wildlife, and natural resources,
    both domestically and internationally. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure
    of most conservation, marine, and land management information would have a limited
    adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > There may be some cases for which moderate confidentiality impact is associated
    with unauthorized disclosure of private or proprietary information associated
    with use of federally owned/controlled lands for commercial use (mineral mining,
    grazing, forestry, fishing, etc.). Additionally, unauthorized disclosure of details
    of current agency conservation, marine, and land management activities and plans
    may focus opposition and/or give an unfair advantage to competing interests. Consistent
    premature disclosure of agency plans may cause significant degradation in mission
    capability. Also, conservation, marine, and land management include enforcement
    functions (e.g., the policing of marine fisheries). Confidentiality impacts associated
    with criminal apprehension, criminal investigation and surveillance, citizen protection,
    and property protection may cause the confidentiality impact of enforcement-related
    information to be moderate or high.

    recreational resource management and tourism information on the ability of responsible
    agencies to manage national parks, monuments, and tourist attractions as well
    as visitor centers, campsites, and park service facilities. The consequences of
    unauthorized disclosure of most recreational resource management and tourism information
    would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Recreational resource management and tourism include enforcement functions (e.g.,
    protective and enforcement functions of the National Park Service). Confidentiality
    impacts associated with criminal apprehension, criminal investigation and surveillance,
    citizen protection, and property protection may cause the confidentiality impact
    of enforcement-related information to be moderate or high. The consequences of

    > In some cases, unauthorized disclosure of preliminary findings or policies under
    consideration regarding proposed agricultural products may result in domestic
    or international public relations problems for the Federal government. In such
    cases, serious damage can result for agricultural innovation and service operations.
    Here, the confidentiality impact level may be moderate. In other cases, unauthorized
    disclosure of information regarding creation, storage, and transportation of dangerous
    plant disease vectors, animal disease vectors, pesticides, and herbicides might
    facilitate malicious activities by terrorists or other criminals. Here, there
    is a potential for loss of human life, so the confidentiality impact level may

    ## Energy Supply (D.7.1)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Energy Supply information is **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    energy supply information on the ability of responsible agencies to conduct activities
    related to the sale and transportation of commodity fuels such as coal, oil, natural
    gas, and radioactive materials. This function also includes distributing and transferring
    power, electric generation, and/or storage located near the point of use. Unauthorized
    modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g.,
    web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence
    in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of energy supply information can
    have a serious economic impact with respect to competitive advantages and financial
    and commodity market dynamics. Also, the unauthorized disclosure of supply information
    may assist terrorists in the theft of energy products or disruption of energy
    distribution channels. Facilitation of theft of nuclear materials is a particularly
    catastrophic potential result of unauthorized disclosure of specific types of
    energy supply information. In these cases, the confidentiality impact must be
    considered to be high. [Some information regarding transportation and storage
    of nuclear materials is classified. The classified information is national security
    related and is outside the scope of this guideline. Other information, such as
    Nuclear Regulatory Commission “SAFEGUARDS” information is not national security
    information, but must be treated as having high confidentiality impact.] 37 Risk
    level is usually high where safety of radioactive materials, highly flammable
    fuels, or major transmission channels or control processes is at risk. 38 Risk
    level is usually moderate or high where mission-critical procedures are involved.
    With respect to possible use by terrorists of energy distribution information
    regarding petroleum, natural gas, and other flammable or explosive products, a
    realistic impact assessment must include energy distribution information from
    private companies. This information is also susceptible to access by terrorists.
    Where distribution of hazardous energy products is involved, there is a potential
    unauthorized disclosure consequence of loss of human life and major property.
    In such cases the confidentiality impact level can be moderate or high. [Disclosure
    of transportation routes and storage facilities is often (i) both authorized and
    necessary to mission accomplishment and (ii) authorized, or even mandated, for
    public safety reasons.] Also, the unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s energy
    supply information by another agency could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional
    coordination within the energy distribution infrastructure and the general effectiveness
    of organizations tasked with energy supply.

    agencies to protect energy resources from over-consumption to ensure the continued
    availability of fuel resources and to promote environmental protection. In most
    cases, unauthorized disclosure of energy conservation and preparedness information
    will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > In some cases, unauthorized disclosure of preliminary findings or policies under
    consideration regarding proposed conservation measures or the distribution of
    energy in the event of an emergency may result in mobilization of special interests.
    These groups may successfully oppose necessary conservation measures and be given
    an unfair advantage for specific commercial interests. Also, the unauthorized
    disclosure may cause domestic or international loss of confidence in the Federal
    government. In such cases, serious damage may result for energy conservation and
    preparedness operations. Therefore, the confidentiality impact level may be moderate.
    In other cases, unauthorized disclosure of information regarding measures taken
    to ensure the provision of energy in the event of an emergency may facilitate
    malicious activities of terrorists. Here, there is a potential for loss of human
    life resulting from extended outages, so the confidentiality impact level may
    be high.

    with respect to management of energy producing resources including facilities,
    land, and offshore resources.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of much energy resource management information can result

    to transformation of raw energy resources into useable, deliverable energy. The
    consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most energy production information
    would have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
    or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of some energy production information can result in
    major financial consequences. In some cases, premature disclosure of this information
    can impact financial markets. Unauthorized disclosure to a single institution
    could damage faith in government institutions, result in adverse financial events,
    and have a serious adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. Therefore,
    the confidentiality impact should be at least moderate for this energy production
    information.

    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > The most serious adverse effects are likely to involve exposure of information
    that is proprietary to an organization or result in damaging publicity for an
    organization. [Unauthorized disclosure of some information can have serious economic
    impact on both individual companies and the broader market place. The consequences
    of such unauthorized disclosures may have an adverse effect on public confidence

    environmental remediation information on the immediate and long-term activities
    of responsible agencies with respect to correcting and offsetting environmental
    deficiencies or imbalances. Serious adverse effects are likely to result from
    1) exposure of information that is premature and not fully checked for accuracy
    and that can damage public confidence in an organization targeted for remedial
    action, 2) unauthorized disclosure of information that is proprietary to an organization,
    3) unauthorized disclosure of information concerning proposed remediation that
    may be used by organizations opposing particular remedial actions, and 4) disclosure
    of an agency’s tactics for enforcing remediation that will have an adverse effect
    on the enforcement action. The consequences of such unauthorized disclosures may
    have a serious adverse effect on public confidence in the agency, have a serious
    adverse effect on agency operations, and place the agency at a significant disadvantage.

    pollution prevention and control information on the abilities of responsible agencies
    to establish environmental standards to control the levels of harmful substances
    emitted into the soil, water and atmosphere. Unauthorized disclosure of pollution
    prevention and control information can result in incomplete information being
    published as agency standards or policy, misunderstandings that prevent or increase
    the difficulty of promulgating standards, or the discrediting of valid proposed
    standards or policies by exposure of partial information out of context. The consequences
    of such unauthorized disclosures may have an adverse effect on public confidence
    in the agency, or agency operations and may place the agency at an operational
    disadvantage. Most unauthorized disclosure of pollution prevention and control
    information will have only a limited adverse effect on the affected agency.

    of business. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most business and
    industry development information would have, at most, a limited adverse effect
    on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > There may be some cases for which moderate confidentiality impact is associated
    with unauthorized disclosure of business/industry development. For example, unauthorized
    disclosure of private information concerning individuals or businesses can result
    in legal expense and serious effects on public confidence in the agency. Similarly,
    unauthorized disclosure of details of current agency business and industry development
    activities and plans can serve to focus opposition and/or give an unfair advantage

    intellectual property protection information on the abilities of responsible agencies
    to enforce intellectual property including inventions, literary and artistic works,
    and symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce. The consequences of
    unauthorized disclosure of the majority of intellectual property protection information
    will result in, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
    assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > There are legislative mandates prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade
    secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact
    level. In the case of patent activities, technical details of applications involving
    inventions with military applications and with deliberations concerning withholding
    patents as a result of national security considerations may be sensitive. (In

    to protect investors from fraud, monopolies, and illegal behavior. This also includes
    deposit protection, creation, regulation, and control of the nation’s currency
    and coinage supply and demand.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > While the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of some financial sector oversight
    information would have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
    assets, or individuals, there are significant exceptions. Unauthorized disclosure
    of much financial sector oversight information can result in major financial consequences.
    This can result in assignment of a high impact level to such information. In some
    cases, premature disclosure of regulatory information can impact major financial
    markets and damage national banking and finance infrastructures. For example,
    unauthorized disclosure of a decision to increase the money supply or of an ongoing
    securities fraud investigation can have a dramatic effect on financial markets.
    This can result in assignment of a high impact level to such information. Unauthorized
    disclosure to a single institution (e.g., a major banking institution or brokerage
    house), could damage faith in regulatory institutions and result in even more
    market disruption and have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on public confidence
    in the agency. This can result in assignment of a high impact level to such information.
    Even where the consequences are limited to giving an unfair market advantage to
    a single financial or commercial institution, unauthorized disclosure can have
    a serious adverse effect on public confidence in the agency and its staff. This
    can result in assignment of a high impact level to such information.

    most cases, unauthorized disclosure of industry sector income stabilization information
    will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.
    However, unauthorized premature disclosure of Federal government plans for industry
    sector income stabilization actions (e.g., grants or subsidies) as well as of
    government economic forecasts and commentary preliminary to formulation of plans
    may result in major financial consequences. Unauthorized and premature disclosure
    to a single institution (e.g., a major manufacturing institution, a major agribusiness
    institution, or a commodity brokerage house), could damage confidence in economic
    stabilization institutions and have a severe adverse effect on public confidence

    is **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    air transportation information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure
    the safe passage of passengers and goods through the air. The protection of air
    transportation from deliberate attack is included in the Transportation Security
    information type under the Homeland Security mission area. Some regulatory and
    tariff enforcement functions associated with the safe passage of passengers and
    goods over land involve sensitive information. These are treated under Law Enforcement.
    In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of air transportation information will
    have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of information (e.g., investigations, maintenance) that
    has not been adequately researched, coordinated, or edited can result in serious
    economic harm to individuals and to corporations. Loss in public confidence is
    a further potential consequence. Additionally, some information associated with
    air transportation functions is proprietary to corporations or subject to privacy
    laws. In such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure
    can be moderate. The sensitivity of air transportation information (e.g., aircraft
    positioning data)can be time or event-driven. For example, passenger lists are
    not releasable to the general public before a flight takes off, but are placed
    in the public domain in the event of a crash. In such cases, the confidentiality
    impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure can be moderate. Also, much military
    air transport information is national security information and is outside the
    scope of this guideline.

    attack involves military operations (D.1), homeland security operations (D.2),
    and law enforcement operations (D.16). In most cases, unauthorized disclosure
    of space operations information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
    operations, assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Civilian space operations are intended to be conducted in the open. Administrative
    and business functions associated with space operations may involve proprietary,
    procurement-sensitive, and Privacy Act information. The Privacy Act Information
    provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication
    information type. In such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized
    disclosure can be moderate. Some information regarding space operations (particularly

    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > In cases where 1) the crimes are not violent and do not involve large property
    losses, and 2) there is no history of violence on the part of the criminal, the
    confidentiality impact may be low or moderate. Given the nature of many of the
    crimes that are the responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences
    associated with unauthorized disclosure of criminal investigation and surveillance

    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    property protection information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure
    the security of civilian and government property. The consequences of unauthorized
    disclosure of property protection information are generally dependent on the nature
    of the property being protected. Where the property being protected is neither
    critical to agency operations nor of such value that its loss would degrade mission
    capability or place the agency at a significant disadvantage, unauthorized disclosure
    would have a limited adverse effect.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where critical infrastructure facilities or key national assets are being protected,
    the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of property protection information
    might reveal vulnerabilities in protection measures to terrorists or other adversaries.
    Where unauthorized disclosure of property protection information associated with
    critical infrastructures, large groups of people, or key national assets is expected
    to be of direct use to terrorists, the confidentiality impact level is high. Most
    protected facilities are not part of national security, the critical infrastructure,
    or key national asset categories. If unauthorized disclosure of property protection
    information resulted in damage to these facilities, serious adverse effects on
    agency operations and assets could reasonably be expected to result. This can
    result in assignment of a moderate or high impact level to such information. Where
    the property being protected involves classified information, the property protection
    information itself might be classified. Some examples include command and control
    and other military facilities, foreign intelligence collection or processing facilities,
    weapons or weapons facilities, and cryptographic activities. National security

    substance control information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce
    legal substances (i.e., alcohol and tobacco) and illegal narcotics laws including
    trafficking, possession, sale, distribution, and other related activities. Unauthorized
    disclosure of a significant proportion of substance control information can compromise
    investigations, cause apprehension operations to fail, and compromise prosecutions.
    This can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations and place the agency
    at a significant disadvantage.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of some routine substance control information is unlikely
    to have more than a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
    or individuals. The confidentiality impact associated with such information is
    low. Where the unauthorized disclosure of information exposes sensitive information
    sources or compromises investigative or interdiction operations, the consequences
    of unauthorized disclosure of substance control information may have a serious
    adverse effect on agency operations, significantly degrade mission capability,
    and/or pose a threat to human life. Where unauthorized disclosure endangers investigations
    in process, investigative or intelligence information sources, or information
    regarding witnesses or other critical case file elements, the danger to human
    life and key agency missions can be significant. Where unauthorized disclosure
    endangers witnesses or law enforcement officers, the impact level must be rated
    as high. Other factors affecting confidentiality impacts associated with substance
    control information are discussed under Section D.16.1 (Criminal Apprehension)
    and Section D.16.2 (Criminal Investigation and Surveillance). Some substance control
    information is classified (e.g., some intelligence-derived information). Classified
    information and other national security information are outside the scope of this

    ## Crime Prevention (D.16.7)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Crime Prevention information is
    **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    crime prevention information on the ability of responsible agencies to create
    safer communities through the control and reduction of crime by addressing the
    causes of crime and reducing the opportunities of crime. Generally, the unauthorized
    disclosure of crime prevention information will have only a limited adverse effect
    on agency operations, assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > In a few cases, details of crime prevention programs are sensitive (e.g., location
    of actively monitored surveillance cameras where only a fraction of camera feeds
    are monitored). In such cases, unauthorized disclosure of crime prevention information
    might have a serious adverse effect on crime prevention operations by eliminating
    uncertainty regarding surveillance patterns. Therefore, the confidentiality impact
    might be moderate.

    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    trade law enforcement information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce
    various Customs laws. Unauthorized disclosure of trade law enforcement information
    could potentially jeopardize fulfillment of other trade law enforcement missions.
    Some information that has supported a trade law enforcement process might be of
    higher sensitivity, and unauthorized disclosure of this information might jeopardize
    the success of future trade law enforcement processes. The subsequent threat to
    agency image or reputation can cause a serious adverse effect on an agency’s mission
    capability. Where information includes names of informants, informant contacts,
    or agency personnel, the effectiveness of those personnel in future enforcement
    activities can be permanently impaired, or their lives threatened. Intelligence
    information falls under national security systems. National security information
    and national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline.

    ## Judicial Hearings (D.17.1)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Judicial Hearings information
    is **Moderate**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    judicial hearings information on the ability of responsible entities to conducting
    a hearing in a court of law to settle a dispute. While much information associated
    with judicial hearings is public, some information is sealed by the court and
    unauthorized disclosure is punishable by law, fine and/or imprisonment. In the
    vast majority of cases, unauthorized disclosure of judicial hearings information
    will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where the life of a victim, witness, or informant may be endangered by unauthorized
    disclosure, the confidentiality impact is high. Also, where the consequences are
    likely to endanger public safety, the confidentiality impact is high.

    ## Legal Defense (D.17.2)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Legal Defense information is **Moderate**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    legal defense information on the representation of a defendant in a criminal/civil
    court of law and on the ability of the government to provide constitutional guarantees
    to legal representation. Dissemination of legal defense information is governed
    by privacy laws and by Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rules of Civil Procedure,
    and other laws governing adversarial legal proceedings. While much information
    associated with legal defense is public, some information is sealed by the court
    or is otherwise protected from disclosure. Violation of rules regarding unauthorized
    disclosure is punishable by law, disbarment, fine, and/or imprisonment. Generally,
    the unauthorized disclosure of legal defense information will have only a limited
    adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Where unauthorized
    disclosure of information might have a serious adverse effect on legal defense,
    there is a presumption of a miscarriage of justice. If an unauthorized disclosure
    is discovered, the legal proceeding may be jeopardized (e.g., a mistrial may be
    declared). The cost to the government and others in terms of finance, time, and
    disruption to normal operations can be severe. If suspicion is raised concerning
    government complicity or negligence, serious loss of public confidence in government
    agencies or the legal process may result.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where the life of a victim, witness, or informant may be endangered by disclosure,
    the confidentiality impact will be high. Also, where the consequences of a miscarriage
    of justice are likely to endanger public safety (e.g., release of a terrorist
    or other murderer), the confidentiality impact will be high.

    ## Legal Investigation (D.17.3)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Legal Investigation information
    is **Moderate**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    legal investigation information on the ability of responsible agencies to gather
    information about a given party (government agency, citizen, corporation) that
    would be admissible in a court of law, in an attempt to prove guilt or innocence.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of legal investigation information
    depend 1] on the seriousness of the crime involved, 2] timing (e.g., the ability
    of the criminal 40 to access the information and use it to commit a crime or to
    evade detection or surveillance), and 3] on the capability criminal to injure
    witnesses or law enforcement officials. In cases where 1) the crimes are not violent
    and do not involve extraordinarily large property losses, and 2) there is no indication
    of a record of violence on the part of the criminal, the confidentiality impact
    may be low or moderate. Given the nature of many of the crimes that are the responsibility
    of Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences associated with unauthorized
    disclosure of legal investigation information will pose a threat to human life
    or result in a loss of major assets. Additionally, when the disclosure concerns
    matters of multi-national interest, such as trade enforcement, tariff agreements,
    etc., or where foreign nationals might be involved, the confidentiality impact
    will be high. Information that reveals the identity and/or location of informants
    may be of particular concern.

    ## Legal Prosecution and Litigation (D.17.4)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Legal Prosecution and Litigation
    information is **Low**:

    legal prosecution/litigation information on the ability of responsible agencies
    to present a case in a legal proceeding either in a criminal or civil court of
    law in an attempt to prove guilt/responsibility. Dissemination of legal prosecution/litigation
    information is governed by privacy laws and by Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rules
    of Civil Procedure, and other laws governing adversarial legal proceedings. While
    most information associated with legal prosecution/litigation is public, some
    information is sealed by the court or is otherwise protected from disclosure.
    Violation of rules regarding unauthorized disclosure is punishable by law, disbarment,
    fine, and/or imprisonment. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of legal prosecution/litigation
    information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets,
    or individuals. In criminal cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure
    of legal prosecution information are affected by 1] the seriousness of the crime
    involved, 2] timing (e.g., the ability of the criminal to access the information
    and use it to commit a crime or evade detection or surveillance), and 3] the capability
    of the criminal to injure witnesses or law enforcement officials.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where unauthorized disclosure of information might have a serious adverse effect
    on legal prosecution/ litigation, there is a presumption of a miscarriage of justice.
    If an unauthorized disclosure is discovered, the legal proceeding is jeopardized
    (e.g., a mistrial may be declared). The cost to the government and others in terms
    of finance, time, and disruption to normal operations can be severe. If suspicion
    is raised concerning government complicity or negligence, serious loss of public
    confidence in government agencies or the legal process may result. In this case,
    the confidentiality impact of unauthorized disclosure will be moderate. Where
    the life of a complainant, victim, witness, or informant may be endangered by
    disclosure, the confidentiality impact will be high. Also, where the consequences
    of a miscarriage of justice are likely to endanger public safety (e.g., release
    of a terrorist or other murderer), the confidentiality impact will be high. Given
    the nature of many of the crimes that are the responsibility of Federal law enforcement
    agencies, the consequences associated with unauthorized disclosure of legal prosecution
    information must be assumed to pose a threat to human life or result in a loss
    of major assets. Additionally, when a legal proceeding concerns matters of trans-national
    interest, such as trade enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or where foreign
    nationals might be involved, the confidentiality impact will be high. Information
    that reveals the identity and/or location of informants may be of particular concern.

    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    resolution facilitation information on the ability of responsible entities to
    settle a dispute between two or more parties (government, citizen, corporation)
    outside of a court of law. While some information associated with resolution facilitation
    is public, much of the information is private and/or proprietary. Unauthorized
    disclosure of such information can disrupt or defeat the dispute resolution process.
    The consequences typically depend on the nature of the dispute. Jeopardy to the
    resolution process will not usually involve threats to critical infrastructures,
    key national assets, or human life. Typically, the unauthorized disclosure of
    resolution facilitation information will have only a limited adverse effect on
    agency operations, assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where large monetary amounts and/or violent crimes are involved, the confidentiality
    impact of unauthorized disclosure of resolution facilitation information is at
    least moderate. In exceptional cases human lives may be jeopardized by failure
    of the resolution facilitation process. Additionally, when resolution facilitation
    concerns matters of trans-national interest, such as trade enforcement, tariff
    agreements, etc., or where foreign nationals might be involved, the confidentiality
    impact will be high.

    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    criminal incarceration information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide
    housing, custody, and general care for criminals sentenced to serve time in a
    Federal penitentiary. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most criminal
    incarceration information are unlikely to have a serious adverse effect on agency
    operations. The most serious adverse effects are likely to involve exposure of
    information that is proprietary to prisoners that can result in damaging publicity
    for an organization. (Unauthorized disclosure of some information can conceivably
    have serious impact on the status or resolution of appeal actions). The consequences
    of unauthorized disclosures may have an adverse effect on public confidence in
    the agency.

    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    criminal rehabilitation information on the ability of responsible agencies to
    provide convicted criminals with the educational resources and life skills necessary
    to rejoin society as responsible and contributing members. The consequences of
    unauthorized disclosure of most criminal rehabilitation information would have
    a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Exceptions that might have a potential for more serious consequences are based
    on privacy information processed in criminal rehabilitation systems (e.g., information
    required by the Privacy Act of 1974 (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact
    levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information
    type) or other statutes and executive orders to receive special handling to protect

    scientific and technical research and innovation information on the ability of
    responsible agencies to create new scientific and/or technological knowledge as
    a goal in itself, without a specific link to other program areas or information
    types. Many scientific and technical research and innovation activities are conducted
    in association with public institutions of higher learning, and the findings resulting
    from those activities are intended for publication.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > The pre-publication disclosure or other unauthorized disclosure of information
    associated with competition for funding and recognition (e.g., grants, development
    contract, patent rights, and copyrights) can have a serious adverse effect on
    agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. In such cases, the confidentiality
    impact level associated for scientific and technical research and innovation information
    will be moderate. In some cases, the information associated with scientific and

    to conduct activities devoted to [1] innovations directed at human and robotic
    space flight and the development and operation of space launch and transportation
    systems, and [2] the general research and exploration of outer space. Many space
    exploration and innovation activities are conducted with public institutions of
    higher learning, and the findings resulting from those activities are intended
    for publication.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > The pre-publication disclosure or other unauthorized disclosure of information
    associated with competition for funding and recognition (e.g., grants, development
    contract, patent rights, and copyrights) can have a serious adverse effect on
    agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. In such cases, the confidentiality
    impact associated with space exploration and innovation is moderate. In some cases,

    ## Research and Development (D.20.1)


    The provisional confidentiality impact level of Research and Development information

    > The confidentiality impact level depends on the effect of unauthorized disclosure
    of research and development information on the ability of responsible agencies
    to gather and analyze data, disseminate results, and develop new products, methodologies,
    and ideas, and on the degree to which unauthorized disclosure of the information
    can assist hostile institutions to do harm to the interests of the government
    of the United States. Many research and development activities are conducted in
    association with public institutions of higher learning, and the findings resulting
    from those activities are intended for publication. Unauthorized disclosure of
    most research and development information can be expected to have only limited
    adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Most research and development information is proprietary. Unauthorized disclosure
    of proprietary information violates several statures and Federal regulations (see
    Appendix E). Pre-publication disclosure or other unauthorized disclosure of research
    findings can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
    or individuals. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level associated with
    research and development is moderate. Premature and/or partial release of preliminary
    research and development information can lead to misleading conclusions by policy
    makers, funding entities, news organizations, and/or the general public. Where
    the research and development activities are associated with security measures
    or law enforcement tools, potential adversaries may derive insights on countermeasures
    development. In extreme cases, the resulting confidentiality impact can be high.
    In some cases, the research and development information is classified or otherwise
    qualifies as national security information). Such information is outside the scope
    of this guideline.

    agencies to provide empirical, numerical, and related data and information pertaining
    to the current state of the nation in areas such as the economy, labor, weather,
    international trade, etc. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most
    general-purpose data and statistics information would have only a limited adverse
    effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized premature disclosure of much economic (e.g., agricultural commodity,
    economic indicators) data and statistics information can result in major financial
    consequences. In some cases, premature disclosure of this information can impact
    major financial markets and damage national banking and finance infrastructures.
    Unauthorized and premature disclosure to a single institution (e.g., a major commodity
    brokerage house), could damage faith in general-purpose data and statistics gathering
    and development institutions, result in even more market disruption, and have
    a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. Even
    when the consequences are limited to giving an unfair market advantage to a single
    financial or commercial institution, unauthorized disclosure can have a serious
    adverse effect on public confidence in the agency and its staff. This can result
    in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

    advising and consulting information on the ability of responsible agencies to
    provide guidance and consultative services to support the implementation of a
    specific service to citizens. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of advising
    and consulting information depends on the nature of the service being provided
    and on the sensitivity of the information with which advisory or consulting entities
    are working. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most advising and
    consulting information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
    agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where consulting support involves classified or other national security information,
    the consequences of unauthorized disclosure can be severe but are outside the
    scope of this guideline. In other cases, such as consultative services provided
    to law enforcement institutions, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure can

    publish or broadcast information. Premature and unauthorized disclosure of information
    being considered for broadcast can be harmful if the information is subsequently
    determined to be false or counterproductive to the knowledge dissemination mission.
    However, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most knowledge dissemination
    information would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
    agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of some policies governing knowledge dissemination missions

    methodically examine and review regulated activities to ensure compliance with
    standards for regulated activity. If the inspections and auditing data belongs
    to one of the information types described in this guideline, the confidentiality
    impact assigned the data and system is dependent on the nature of the regulated
    activity.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Unauthorized disclosure of inspections and auditing information can alert personnel
    associated with programs being monitored to the focus of inspection or auditing
    activities. With this information, program personnel may divert attention from
    questionable program attributes or hide unfavorable information. Where a major
    program or human safety is at stake, actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure
    of inspections and auditing information can pose a threat to human life or a loss

    compliance with allowable limits. In a few cases, the unauthorized public dissemination
    of standards or guidelines information can harm the effectiveness of the function
    being supported (e.g., public dissemination of Internal Revenue Service audit
    thresholds for certain deductions). However, most Federal standards and guidelines
    are intended for public dissemination. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure
    of the majority of standards setting/reporting guideline development information
    will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
    individuals. There are some cases for which standards or guidelines include classified

    The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the majority of permits and licensing
    information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
    assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where more sensitive information is involved, it will typically be personal
    information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act of 1996, or other laws and executive orders affecting the
    dissemination of information regarding individuals. The Privacy Act Information

    on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > In some cases, premature unauthorized disclosure of management information can
    give an unfair competitive advantage to a commercial interest (e.g., proposed

    In other cases, public resources, facilities, and infrastructure management details
    can be of use to terrorists or other criminals who seek to penetrate the security
    of government property or to harm populations. Unauthorized disclosure of some
    public resources, facilities, and infrastructure management details to criminals

    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    federal grants information on the ability of responsible agencies to disburse
    funds to non-Federal entities to fund projects or activities. Typically, unauthorized
    disclosure of federal grants information will have only a limited adverse effect
    on agency operations, assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > In a few cases, records associated with grants may include information subject
    to privacy restrictions (e.g., the Privacy Act of 1974). The Privacy Act Information
    provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication
    information type. In many cases, premature and unauthorized disclosure can affect
    the integrity of the grants process, giving an unfair competitive advantage to
    one or more applicants. In such cases, punitive consequences and/or loss of public
    confidence can have a seriously disruptive effect on an agency’s operations and
    mission. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level would be moderate. In
    some cases, federal grants information might be moderate to high impact. Also,
    details of programs for which grants are awarded may be sensitive (e.g., research
    grants for weapons systems project activities). Some federal grants information
    and some grant program details may be classified and outside the scope of this
    guideline.

    to disburse funds from the Federal Government directly to beneficiaries (individuals
    or organizations) who satisfy Federal eligibility requirements with no restrictions
    imposed on the recipient as to how the money is spent. In the majority of cases,
    unauthorized disclosure of direct transfers to individuals will have only a limited
    adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Many of the records associated with the disbursements may include information
    subject to privacy restrictions (e.g., the Privacy Act of 1974, HIPAA of 1996).
    (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal

    funds to affect the production or prices of various goods to benefit the public
    benefit. In many cases, unauthorized disclosure of subsidies information will
    have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Some information associated with applications for subsidies includes information
    covered by the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. (The Privacy Act Information
    provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication
    information type.) Unauthorized disclosure of large volumes of information protected
    under the Privacy Act can be expected to have a serious effect on public confidence
    in the agency. Also, premature unauthorized disclosure of planned subsidies policies
    can affect financial/commodities markets, with associated potential adverse effects
    on the U.S. economy and serious adverse effects on public confidence in the agency.

    exclusions, exemptions, or deductions from gross income or which provide special
    credits, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability designed to
    encourage certain kinds of activities or to aid taxpayers in special circumstances.
    Many of the records associated with disbursements may include information subject
    to privacy restrictions (e.g., the Privacy Act of 1974, the Internal Revenue Code
    and Manual, or the Economic Espionage Act). (The provisional impact levels for
    personnel information are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication,
    Income, Representative Payee, and Entitlement Event information types.) In such
    cases, punitive consequences and/or loss of public confidence can have a seriously

    direct loan information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
    assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:

    insurance, or other pledges with respect to the payment of all or a part of the
    principal or interest on any debt obligation of a non-Federal borrower to a non-Federal
    lender. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of loan guarantee information will
    have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Much loan guarantee information includes information covered by the provisions
    of the Privacy Act of 1974. (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels
    are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.)

    is **Low**:


    > The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
    general insurance information on the abilities of responsible agencies to provide
    protection to individuals or entities against specified risks. General insurance
    activities include both insurance issuing and insurance servicing. Insurance issuing
    is any activity such as provider approval, underwriting, and endorsements. The
    consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance issuing information will
    generally result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
    or individuals. Insurance servicing supports activities associated with administering
    and processing insurance include payment processing, initial and final closings,
    loss mitigation, claims management, and retiring insurance. The confidentiality
    impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information
    on the abilities of responsible agencies to administer and process insurance.
    The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information
    will generally result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
    assets, or individuals.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > The more serious consequences may result from 1) unauthorized disclosure of
    provider’s proprietary information, or 2) premature disclosure of agency plans
    or changes under consideration for contracts, plans, or policies. Unauthorized
    disclosure of information that can affect contract arrangements to the detriment
    of the interests of the government, and of the public at large (e.g., planned
    or anticipated termination of a major contract insurer), can result in damaging
    increases in public expense and exposure to impact. In the case of unauthorized
    disclosure to an individual private sector organization, unfair competitive advantage
    may result – with major financial consequences. In the case of unauthorized disclosure
    of preliminary and unsubstantiated data that is both incorrect and pessimistic
    (e.g., Medicare budget projections,), the consequent unwarranted alarm of the
    public may have serious political and operational consequences for affected agencies.
    In the more serious cases, the confidentiality impact will be at least moderate.
    The more serious consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing
    information may result from unauthorized disclosure of private information concerning
    the insured (e.g., Privacy Act information). (The Privacy Act Information provisional
    impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information
    type.) In the more serious cases, the confidentiality impact will be at least
    moderate.

    prescribed by law or administrative regulation, for activities of a continuing
    nature. Typically, unauthorized disclosure of most formula grants information
    will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.
    In most cases, information associated with formula grants is public knowledge.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > In a few cases, details of programs for which formula grants are awarded may
    be sensitive (e.g., some Federal/State cooperative programs intended to support
    Homeland Security operations). This can result in assignment of a moderate or

    Is the integrity impact level {{information_types_integrity_provisional}}?

    Based on the information type(s) you chose from NIST SP 800-60 Vol II, the provisional
    impact of a loss of integrity is **{{information_types_integrity_provisional}}**.

    {# FIPS 199 #}

    A loss of integrity is the unauthorized modification or destruction of information,
    with consequences such as:

    {# NIST 800-60 Vol 1 #}

    * Reducing public confidence in an agency

    * Fraudulently achieving financial gain

    * Creating confusion or controversy by promulgating a fraudulent or incorrect
    procedure

    * Initiating confusion or controversy through false attribution of a fraudulent
    or false policy

    * Influencing personnel decisions

    * Interfering with or manipulate law enforcement or legal processes

    * Influencing legislation

    * Achieving unauthorized access to government information or facilities

    {% if information_types_integrity_provisional == "Low" %}
    The potential impact is Low if the loss of integrity could be expected to have
    a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets,
    or individuals. A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of
    integrity might: (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and
    duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the
    effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage
    to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial loss; or (iv) result
    in minor harm to individuals. (NIST SP 800-60 Vol 1 Rev 1){% endif %}

    {% if information_types_integrity_provisional == "Moderate" %}
    The potential impact is moderate if the loss of integrity could be expected to
    have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets,
    or individuals. A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of
    integrity might: (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability to
    an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions,
    but the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in
    significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in significant financial
    loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals that does not involve
    loss of life or serious life threatening injuries. (NIST SP 800-60 Vol 1 Rev 1){% endif %}

    {% if information_types_integrity_provisional == "High" %}
    The potential impact is high if the loss of integrity could be expected to have
    a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational
    assets, or individuals. A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for
    example, the loss of integrity might: (i) cause a severe degradation in or loss
    of mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is not able
    to perform one or more of its primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to
    organizational assets; (iii) result in major financial loss; or (iv) result in
    severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life
    threatening injuries. (NIST SP 800-60 Vol 1 Rev 1){% endif %}

    that level based on the specifics of your information system.

    Ask yourself:

    {# NIST 800-60 Vol 1 #}

    * How can a malicious adversary use the unauthorized modification or destruction
    of information to do limited, serious, or severe harm to agency operations, agency
    assets, or individuals?

    * Would unauthorized modification/destruction of elements of the information type
    violate laws, executive orders, or agency regulations?

    ## Corrective Action (C.2.1.1)


    The provisional integrity impact level of Corrective Action information is **Low**:


    > The consequences of undetected unauthorized modification or destruction of corrective
    action information can conceivably compromise the effectiveness of compliance
    enforcement actions (e.g., by providing violators with a basis for claiming investigative
    or enforcement irregularities, thus supporting legal challenges to proposed corrective
    actions). The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the
    data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification
    or destruction of information. Unauthorized modification or destruction of most
    corrective action information should have only a limited adverse effect on agency
    operations, assets, or individuals.

    evaluation information can compromise the effectiveness of an evaluation program
    (e.g., by providing false information intended to mislead investigators or evaluators
    or to give program personnel a basis for claiming investigative or evaluative
    irregularities). The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and
    the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification
    or destruction of information. Although there are time-sensitive exceptions, unauthorized
    modification or destruction of most program evaluation information should have
    only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

    ## Program Monitoring (C.2.1.3)


    The provisional integrity impact level of Program Monitoring information is **Low**:


    > The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of program monitoring
    information can compromise the effectiveness of the monitoring program. Although
    there may be time-sensitive program monitoring situations, the integrity impact
    level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not
    on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.
    The damage likely to be caused by unauthorized modification or destruction of
    program monitoring information may have consequent serious adverse effects on
    agency operations or public confidence in the agency.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > The consequences can be particularly serious if the destruction or modification
    of monitoring information invalidates evaluation results concerning major programs
    or concerning threats to human safety. The integrity impact resulting from unauthorized
    modification or deletion of program monitoring information depends in part on
    the nature of the laws or policies with which compliance is being determined and
    in part on the criticality of the processes being monitored. For example, in the
    case of safety regulations affecting manned space flight, the integrity impact
    level may be high.

    > The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting
    that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction
    of information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of
    travel information partially depends on the urgency with which the information
    is normally needed and the consequences of aborted or modified travel. In the
    case of travel planning information, the effects of such modifications are generally
    limited with respect to agency mission capabilities or assets. There may be scenarios
    in which integrity compromise of travel information may expose Federal leadership
    to harm or endanger a sensitive or critical operation. However, most such scenarios
    are dealt with in the context of impacts to mission operations information (Appendix

    > Some air transportation functions are time- critical (e.g., air traffic control
    instructions, position reports, situational awareness, separation, weather reports
    for the terminal area, microburst tracking, maintenance trouble reports). Communications
    management (e.g., frequency management) information also needs to be included
    in air transportation integrity impact considerations. There may be circumstances
    under which erroneous frequency assignment information can result in a loss of
    communications with aircraft that are affected by hazardous conditions (e.g.,
    loss of communications with an aircraft in a crowded air space.) Unauthorized
    modification or destruction of time-critical information necessary to these functions
    can result in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives. The Wide Area
    Augmentation System (WAAS) supplements the availability and integrity of position
    information available from the DoD's Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Because
    of the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of integrity of this system,
    a high integrity impact level is recommended. The following example illustrates
    the use of controls to address a high integrity impact level: Systems designed
    for command and control for air traffic control (e.g., the NAS systems) have been
    designed for robust operations. In the NAS, integrity and availability issues
    are closely linked. The loss of integrity in a system is monitored continuously,
    and the loss of integrity is treated as a loss of availability, and in general,
    loss of availability for the majority of systems does not cause derogation in
    safety. That is, if the operational parameters for an Instrument Landing System
    are detected to be out of established tolerances, the system is immediately removed
    from service - it is powered down and users are notified that the particular service
    is not available. In most cases, a loss of availability is preferred to continued
    availability with degraded integrity. The impacts of the loss of availability
    due to the loss of integrity include system-wide air traffic delays, diversion
    of traffic to alternate airports - and the economic losses related to those delays,

    a serious adverse effect on agency operations may result. This can place the agency
    at a significant disadvantage.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Legal investigation mission requirements may include time-critical information.
    In such cases, major investigations can be jeopardized by the unauthorized modification
    or destruction of legal investigation information. Where the criminal case under
    investigation involves major property losses, large-scale financial frauds, poses
    a threat to key national assets or human life, the integrity impact level recommended
    for legal investigation information is high. 40 In this case, the term “criminal
    entity” includes both the criminal and legal representative(s) of the criminal
    (i.e., council). When legal investigation information addresses international
    matters, such as trade enforcement or tariff agreements or when foreign nationals
    are involved, the integrity level is high. Any deliberate or inadvertent corruption
    of such information could result in catastrophic adverse effects on future operations,
    individual or agency reputations, and human life.

    ## Legal Prosecution and Litigation (D.17.4)


    The provisional integrity impact level of Legal Prosecution and Litigation information
    is **Moderate**:


    > The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting
    that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction
    of information. Legal prosecution/litigation activities are not typically time-critical.
    Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
    associated with legal prosecution/litigation organizations (e.g., web pages, electronic
    mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but
    the damage to the mission would usually be limited. In general, the unauthorized
    modification or destruction of legal prosecution/litigation information will have
    only a limited adverse effect on government operations, government assets, or
    individuals. However, if evidence or other defense information has been compromised,
    legal proceedings may be affected (e.g., a mistrial may be declared). The subsequent
    cost to the government in terms of finance, time, and disruption to normal operations
    may be severe. If suspicion is raised concerning government complicity or negligence,
    serious loss of public confidence in government agencies or the legal process
    may result.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > Where the life of a victim, witness, or informant may be endangered, the integrity
    impact will be high. Also, where the consequences of a miscarriage of justice
    are likely to endanger public safety (e.g., release of a terrorist or other murderer),
    the integrity impact will be high.

    of information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of
    criminal incarceration information can be serious if the information is time-critical
    and results in the premature release of a criminal, unjust retention of an individual
    in the prison system, or harm to a citizen’s reputation or public confidence in
    the government.


    Examples why you may need to change the level:


    > In some cases (e.g., instructions regarding a need to isolate a prisoner from
    the general prison population for personal safety reasons), the unauthorized modification
    or destruction of criminal incarceration information can result in loss of human

- id: information_types_availability_review
  title: Check provisional availability impact level
  type: yesno
  prompt: |
    Is the availability impact level {{information_types_availability_provisional}}?

    Based on the information type(s) you chose from NIST SP 800-60 Vol II, the provisional
    impact of a loss of availability is **{{information_types_availability_provisional}}**.

    {# FIPS 199 & NIST SP 800-60 Vol 1 #}

    A loss of availability is the disruption of access to or use of information or
    an information system.

    For many information types and information systems,
    the availability impact level depends on how long the information or system remains
    unavailable. Undetected loss of availability can be catastrophic for many information
    types. For example, permanent loss of budget execution, contingency planning,
    continuity of operations, service recovery, debt collection, taxation management,
    personnel management, payroll management, security management, inventory control,
    logistics management, or accounting information databases would be catastrophic
    for almost any agency. Complete reconstruction of such databases would be time
    consuming and expensive. (NIST SP 800-60 Vol 1 Rev 1)

    What potential impact would a loss of availability have?

    {% if information_types_availability_provisional == "Low" %}
    The potential impact is Low if the loss of availability could be expected to have
    a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets,
    or individuals. A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of
    availability might: (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and
    duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the
    effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage
    to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial loss; or (iv) result
    in minor harm to individuals. (NIST SP 800-60 Vol 1 Rev 1){% endif %}

    {% if information_types_availability_provisional == "Moderate" %}
    The potential impact is moderate if the loss of availability could be expected to
    have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets,
    or individuals. A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of
    availability might: (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability to
    an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions,
    but the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in
    significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in significant financial
    loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals that does not involve
    loss of life or serious life threatening injuries. (NIST SP 800-60 Vol 1 Rev 1){% endif %}

    {% if information_types_availability_provisional == "High" %}
    The potential impact is high if the loss of availability could be expected to have
    a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational
    assets, or individuals. A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for
    example, the loss of availability might: (i) cause a severe degradation in or loss
    of mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is not able
    to perform one or more of its primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to
    organizational assets; (iii) result in major financial loss; or (iv) result in
    severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life
    threatening injuries. (NIST SP 800-60 Vol 1 Rev 1){% endif %}

    You may {% if information_types_availability_provisional == "Low" %}need to raise
    {% elif information_types_availability_provisional == "Moderate" %}need to raise or lower
    {% elif information_types_availability_provisional == "High" %}in certain cases lower{% endif %}
    that level based on the specifics of your information system.

    Ask yourself:

    {# NIST SP 800-60 Vol 1 #}

    * How can a malicious adversary use the disruption of access to or use of information to do limited,
    serious, or severe harm to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals?

    * Would disruption of access to or use of elements of the information type violate laws, executive

    > Some air transportation functions are time-critical (e.g., air traffic control
    instructions, position reports, situational awareness, separation, weather reports
    for the terminal area, microburst tracking, maintenance trouble reports). Loss
    of availability of time-critical information necessary to these functions can
    result in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives. Timing plays a
    large part in the availability impact of air transportation information. For example,
    the time criticality of weather information may be measured in minutes or hours
    in the case of pre-flight and mid-flight operations. However, on final landing
    approach, up to the second availability may be required (e.g., detection of microbursts
    in the terminal area). Air operations are not tolerant of information loss. The
    Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) supplements the availability of information
    available from the Department of Defense's Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Because
    of the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of availability of this system,
    it would be appropriately categorized as having a high availability impact. The
    following example illustrates the use of controls to address a high integrity
    impact level: The systems designed for command and control for air traffic control
    (e.g., the NAS systems) have been designed for robust operations. However, in
    general, loss of availability for the majority of systems does not cause derogation
    in safety. The impacts of a loss of availability (or the loss of availability
    due to the loss of integrity) include local or system-wide air traffic delays,
    diversion of traffic to alternate airports, etc., and the economic losses related
    to those delays, diversions, etc. Severe impacts are not the norm because the
    loss of availability is inevitable, and the systems have been designed to accommodate
    failures. In light of the above, the Recommended Availability Impact Level is
    moderate.

  title: Impact of Other Considerations

    ## Aggregation

    {# NIST SP 800-60 #}
    Some information may have little or no sensitivity in isolation but may be highly sensitive in
    aggregation. In some cases, aggregation of large quantities of a single information type can
    reveal sensitive patterns and plans, or facilitate access to sensitive or critical systems. In other
    cases, aggregation of information of several different and seemingly innocuous types can have
    similar effects. In general, the sensitivity of a given data element is likely to be greater in
    context than in isolation (e.g., association of an account number with the identity of an individual
    and/or institution).

    The availability, routine operational employment, and sophistication of data
    aggregation and inference tools are all increasing rapidly. If review reveals increased sensitivity
    or criticality associated with information aggregates, then the system security objective impact
    levels may need to be adjusted to a higher level than would be indicated by the security impact
    levels associated with any individual information type. This could be implemented by
    incorporating a statement that explains the aggregation and potential security objective affected
    as well as the modification to impact levels.

    ## Critical System functionality

    Compromise of some information types may have low impact in the context of a system’s
    primary function but may have much more significance when viewed in the context of the
    potential impact of compromising:

    * Other systems to which the system in question is connected, or

    * Other systems which are dependent on that system’s information.

    Access control information for a system that processes only low impact information might
    initially be thought to have only low impact security objectives. However, if access to that
    system might result in some form of access to other systems (e.g., over a network), the sensitivity
    and criticality attributes of all systems to which such indirect access can result needs to be
    considered. Similarly, some information may, in general, have low sensitivity and/or criticality
    security objectives. However, that information may be used by other systems to enable
    extremely sensitive or critical functions (e.g., air traffic control use of weather information or use
    of commercial flight information to identify military combat transport systems). Loss of data
    integrity, availability, temporal context, or other context can have catastrophic consequences.

    ## Other considerations

    Other considerations listed by NIST SP 800-60 Vol 1 include:

    * Extenuating Circumstances

    * Public Information Integrity

    * Catastrophic Loss of System Availability

    * Large Supporting and Interconnecting Systems

    * Critical Infrastructures and Key Resources

    * Trade Secrets

    (We'll get to Privacy Information later.)

    What types of Personally Identifiable Information does the information system
    collect?

    Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is any information about an individual
    that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity or is linkable
    to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.

    {# NIST SP 800-122 #}

    Some Personally Identifiable Information does not need to have its confidentiality protected,
    such as information that the organization has permission or authority to release publicly
    (e.g., an organization‘s public phone directory) or in cases where the data has been de-identified
    sufficiently that it cannot be linked to a specific individual or group.

    What types of Personally Identifiable Information does the information system collect, excluding
    information that does not need to be protected and de-identified data?
  choices:
  - key: name
    text: Name, such as full name, maiden name, mother‘s maiden name, or alias
  - key: number
    text: Personal identification number, such as social security number (SSN), passport
      number, driver’s license number, taxpayer identification number, or financial
      account or credit card number
  - key: address
    text: Address information, such as street address or email address
  - key: characteristics
    text: Personal characteristics, including photographic image (especially of face
      or other identifying characteristic), fingerprints, handwriting, or other biometric
      data (e.g., retina scan, voice signature, facial geometry)

    text: Information about an individual that is linked or linkable to one of the
      above (e.g., date of birth, place of birth, race, religion, weight, activities,

    What is the impact level of a loss of confidentiality of Personally Identifiable
    Information?

    Quantifying the potential damage or harm caused from a breach of confidentiality
    of Personally Identifiable Information is recommended when determining the confidentiality
    impact level and appropriate safeguards to secure Personally Identifiable Information
    data in a system.

    The Personally Identifiable Information impact levels are low, moderate, or high
    and indicate the potential harm that could result to individuals and/or the organization
    if Personally Identifiable Information were inappropriately accessed, used, or
    disclosed.

    Harm is defined by NIST 800-122 as any adverse effects that would be experienced
    by an individual whose Personally Identifiable Information was the subject of
    a loss of confidentiality, as well as any adverse effects experienced by the organization
    that maintains the information.

    Harm to an individual includes any negative or unwanted effects (i.e., that may
    be socially, physically, or financially damaging). Examples of types of harm to
    individuals include, but are not limited to, the potential for blackmail, identity
    theft, physical harm, discrimination, or emotional distress.

    help: A breach of the confidentiality of PHI at the low impact level would not
      cause harm greater than inconvenience, such as changing a private health care
      provider web portal password or telephone number. For example, a research team
      is using de-indentified or obfuscated medical data that cannot be traced back
      to the original dat source or PHI record but the organization may still have
      to comply with PHI protocols as a result of grant or contract conditions that
      mandate the data remains secure until a study is released to the public once
      the data analysis has been completed and authorized for public release.
  - key: Moderate
    text: Moderate
    help: The types of harm that could be caused by a breach involving PHI at the
      moderate impact level include financial loss due to identity theft or denial
      of benefits, public humiliation, discrimination, and the potential for blackmail.
      From an organizational perspective it would also result in fines and loss of
      reputation or public confidence in the institution as a result of a PHI breach.  For
      example, an organization may lose a few PHI records after discovering  a hospital
      employee was using their access to medical records to notify the media of celebrity
      medical conditions.  This in turn, caused the covered entity to have to file
      an insurance claim to cover the mandated state and federal fines associated
      with the incident, termination of the employees and also resulted in bad press
      for the covered entity.  The covered entity (in this care a hospital) also had
      to legally settle lawsuits by the celebrities who who were impacted by the data
      that was publicly released.
  - key: High
    text: High
    help: For example, if the breach by a covered entity is incredibly large and spans
      multiple interconnected covered entities where the fines for a massive breach
      would bankrupt the entity or entities, then that would be a reason to rate the
      harm as high.  Damages to a person could include being rated as uninsurable
      medically for life if the data were to be released in public as part of a breach
      based on severe or multiple pre-existing or chronic medical conditions that
      are financially costly to treat.  That could ultimately result in loss of life
      of the affected person and would make harm in this example High.
