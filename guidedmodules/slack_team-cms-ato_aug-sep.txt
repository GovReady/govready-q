@tom.camp here's some notes on the catalog issue (if you're creating the ticket):
Imported OSCAL component but no statements found
Suspected reason: ARS 3.1 ("ARS-3-1") catalog not loaded
Possible remediation: on import, check source metadata; if matching catalog not found, abort the import with a message: "catalog XYZ not loaded"

@Greg Elin quick question regarding Govready admins that are added to it by default at deploy time. If those admins already exist in db, does Govready give preference to db admin data (credentials etc) OR it picks up the admins passed to it every time and overwrite db admins with these admin in json?

@tom.camp @fen @Jake The OSCAL for the CMS components needs to refer to source as "source": "CMS_ARS_3_1", instead of "source": "ARS-3-1", b/c of current referencing naming conventions for catalogs. I’m going to try and change them. But wanted to let you know.

@Greg Elin Greg, do you have a preference for what’d you call this particular screen? To me this is where’d someone would review/accept, download files or export their SSP and possibly see notifications for what is done or not. Summary seems correct as you have it - but just want to make sure we are calling it the same thing.
Also, I’ve seen this somewhat mentioned in pieces of conversations, just wanted to note it also has a design ticket already in the backlog https://jiraent.cms.gov/projects/ISPGBSS/issues/ISPGBSS-387 (edited)

Latest release of GovReady 0.9.7:tada: https://github.com/GovReady/govready-q/releases/tag/v0.9.7. Bye everyone its been real :tada:
UI changes
Display datagrid question wider and with smaller fonts.
Display existance of legacy statement in project system's selected controls.
Developer changes
Support datagrid specifying select type cell.
Added new function OSCAL_ssp_export in order to export a system's security plan in OSCAL, this replaces the usual JSON export. Added a several fields of data for OSCAL SSP.
If a component to be imported has a catalog key that is not found in the internal or external catalog list then it will be skipped and logged
If no statements are created the resulting element/component is deleted
Component and System Security Plan exports pass OSCAL 1.0.0 schema validation
Added a proxy for parties and responsible parties for component OSCAL export
Coverage 6.0b1 starts to use a modern hash algorithm (sha256) when fingerprinting for high-security environments, upgrading to avoid this safety fail.
Validate Component import and SSP with trestle the package
Bug fixes
Fix count on project system's components associated with a control (avoid double counting)

@Greg Elin - Another UI question; When I add a component to a project, I click Components, search for the Component in the Add component dropped down, but I only get one result for the component that I've searched for and it is automagically added if I click on it.

Hi @tom.camp, @fen, and @Sara Graber - I just had a really nice conversation with Andres about the analysis, components, and candidates. I want to share the feedback I got from him (I'm sure much of this is not new info):
Potential goals for next year (things he mentioned):
Moving the completed components (for the library) to its own drop down in GitHub Pages (this is currently mixed in with the analysis and WIP components - he feels it is hard to find which are "done")
Expanding components candidates (150 from 111 we have today)
50 components [in the library] in the first half of the year
This, I think, will require the automating of the creation of components
In my mind, this will require much better and complex NLP
Automating the evaluation of existing SSPs (SSP Scorecard) - leveraging NLP
Finding components in an SSP and comparing them to our component library (How much do you diverge from a component)
How much do you diverge from [ARS] guidance
Generally speaking, Andres seems to be hot on using analytics. I certainly am excited about talking to him more. He had a bunch of questions about the analysis that is in the github pages and really appreciated (and I think really understood) the purpose behind them.
I think there are some genuine opportunities here. Looking forward to working with you all to help seem them into reality!

Sara Graber  2:04 PM
This is great info @Jake yes nothing surprising to me so thats a relief. Any none of this is for MVP so that's also important to remember

fen  2:15 PM
Very cool stuff. Some thoughts:
1. Moving the completed components (for the library) to its own drop down in GitHub Pages
In addition, we currently copy them to https://github.com/CMSgov/component-library which has the goal of becoming a standard format used by compliance libraries everywhere
3.a. require the automating of the creation of components
There are multiple ways to support this process
4. Automating the evaluation of existing SSPs (SSP Scorecard)
There's some good initial work on this at https://github.com/uscensusbureau/fismatic
Of course, once in code evaluations can be automated with InSpec-style verifications
4.a. Finding components in an SSP and comparing them to our component library
This has been a key goal of the SSP refactoring process for which Jake's analysis will be key

Good Morning team.
I wanted to take a minute and thank you all especially @tom.camp for supporting me this week. As some of you know I had alot going on personally, and professionally and was tryin to just keep driving forward regardless of all the mental health impact it was taking on me.
I was really starting to crack and the end of last week my husband stepped in and said we need to go away just the two of us, without the kids you need to get a break from it all.
So we planned a trip to miami and I was excited to go. I was working on an out of office plan when I started looking at the numbers from miami. I was like I don't care that we're both vaccinated I am not going somewhere like that so we canceled the trip.
Monday was a regular work day and I was planning on being in the office the rest of the week. Monday evening my husband said to bad, I'm taking you to NY. He organized the whole thing and basically forced (in a good way) me to take care of myself, my mental and physical health and I am so grateful for him to see what I didnt see.
But now I come to the point of this message.
I am sorry for not being on top of me being out of the office. I did not think I would be and really feel like I dropped the ball with my teams in the way this all rolled out. so for that I apologize and hope you all forgive me.
Don't be like me, don't wait till you are cracking to be forced to take the time you need. take the time. speak up. raise the flag. let the ppl who care about you step in and help when you need it cuz we are all only human.
Happy to be back, rejuvenated and looking forward to catching up today. :purple_heart: :purple_heart:

Export to CAAT is “the current recommended file format for importing SSP content to CMS CFACTS”

Export/Dowload OSCAL is “the next generation NIST standard format for machine-readable SSPS”

Our current component library addresses 80 controls (487 if we include cmsinherited). Referencing 800-53r4 SSPs, there are about 150 private/hybrid controls to be implemented (not inherited) in a Moderate FedRAMP-cloud-based system, so we're roughly about halfway to coverage.

Yep, agreed. My thinking is that if the information is relevant to the process then it should be shown in one place. But, again, this is your bailiwick, not mine.

Both Splunk and internal tools are used for logging security monitoring, audits and troubleshooting. Splunk includes specification of log types and source systems that are candidates for Splunk log capture and management."

@tom.camp @fen I spoke with Alex regarding the GovReady-Q containers for local desktop dev work, often referred to as dev_env after the directory where the launch script is. From Alex:
Images are blown away, but the caching layer isn’t…However, in dev_env, the images are persistant and only rebuild if the image and caching layers are destroyed (which doesn’t happen unless manually). The pip install is always ran in dev_env due to the fact that thing can change between branches vs in deployments in the Dockerfile since it’s mean to build as an image.
So I think the delay may be in re-running the pip install routine that might change when switching branches.
Always happy to look at PR’s for improvements.

@Sara Graber / @fen / @Greg Elin - I was able to sort out the SSP docx issue. There is inconsistency in the way that we are assigning the IDs for the CMS specific controls; AP-CMS-01, AR-CMS-01, DI-CMS-01, etc. Because the naming convention [FAMILY]-CMS-[PART] is not standard, the component, the catalog and baseline are using either, and in some cases both, [FAMILY]-CMS-01 or [FAMILY]-CMS-1. If we make that consistent the SSP docx generates correctly. This gets us considerably closer to the MVP than we were yesterday. (edited)

@tom.camp for this ticket, we need the "Learn more" button to open the website on a new tab so as not to navigate users out of the application. Thanks! https://jiraent.cms.gov/browse/ISPGBSS-529

@tom.camp should we be able to see the "your responsibility" messages yet on controls (or is that still being worked on?)

tom.camp  1:36 PM
No, that code has not been merged yet, @Andrea Chappelear

@tom.camp we reviewed the build and made comments in the QA document and associated Jira tickets. At this point, our main concern for MVP is the contents of the "CMS AWS System Additional Info" and the "System Profile - Technical Information" modules in the "System Information" section, as we have not reviewed/edited those at all. If we plan/need to include these questions, we should review them... do we need to include them?

@Sara Graber / @fen / @Azhar - I've updated dev.govready.internal... with the latest develop, so you can add Inheritances via the admin UI and then you can update the controls per component. Ping me in the a.m. and I will walk you through the process.

Ben  9:17 AM
Hey @Greg Elin, it looks the "Your Responsibility" box is now up on https://test.govready.internal.cms.gov/. Thanks! A couple of questions:
What does "55" mean for responsibility? My understanding is that this box should be populated by either Fully inherited, Shared, or Fully Allocated.
I'm only seeing "Your Responsibility" boxes that include "Write a Control Narrative to match your system and include all required information" (the message associated with Fully Allocated controls). Are there controls in the system where I can see the messaging for Fully inherited and Shared?

Nick
Meeting on Friday with Gus to work out import to CFACTS, biggest item
Balance 6
Gus
Validating that Nick, Fen, and Gus are going over import in CFACTS (going to take time)
After meeting
Andres: We need to go through the process of creating SSP, is there time this week for Fen and Gus to do this?
Fen: I will run through it myself and take notes. We have 106 controls
Andres: as part of success of MVP we worked on a draft SSP, exported and imported
Gus: need to make sure you're in the validation environment (that's what we're going to test on Friday)
The dummy system we created in CFACTS - need to make sure the file is in an area where CFACTS can access and upload it. We'll test all that. If it works for 1 or 2 controls, it will work for 150.
Fen: right now we have all of inherited
Gus: I call it success if you can do all of this on your own after Friday.
Andres: We have started the GR SSP, do you feel like there is work to do to get SSP to where it needs to be?
Fen: Yes, some components are incomplete (Django, etc.), we're going to need to improve them. There are another 100 controls or so we need. Working with Jake to come up with components and look at components available from CASS team
Andres: Some work to do, but good progress.
Fen: "Ready for Review" status would be good
