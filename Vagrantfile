# This file is based on our CentOS 7 installation instructions at docs/source/deploy_rhel7_centos7.md
# (also at https://govready-q.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy_rhel7_centos7.html). See that file for
# details and *please* keep the steps in this file in sync with the steps in the documentation.
# The setup here differs from the documentation in the following ways:
# * Rather than creating a govready-q UNIX user, we use the default 'vagrant' user.
# * We don't need to clone the Q source code because the Q root directory is already mounted at /vagrant.
# * Python packages are installed by pip at the system level rather than with --user since this machine is expected to be easily thrown away (I guess we could 'sudo -u vagrant).
# * We configure Q with using 'jq' to construct the file, setting the hostname to the IP address of the VM.
# * We turn debug mode off, and consequently must specify a static path and run collectstatic to serve static assets.
# * We copy & edit the supervisord config because the paths are different.
#
# Usage:
# git clone https://github.com/govready/govready-q
# cd govready-q
# git checkout {choose the tag for the current released version}
# vagrant up
# vagrant ssh -- -t manage first_run                     (note that the -t creates a TTY for interactive input)
# visit http://192.168.150.150:3031/ in your browser!
