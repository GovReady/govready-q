GovReady-Q Release Notes
========================

v0.9.0.dev30+devel
------------------

Introduces improved permissions model using Django-Guardian and concept of Portfolios, which replaces both concepts of both Orgnizations and Groups.

Portfolios are used to organize Projects and manage extensible permissions and access.

* When a new user joins GovReady they are automatically added and made owner of their own Portfolio
* Users can be invited to a Portfolio by Portfolio owners and granted ownership by Portfolio owners
* Any user can create a portfolio and add projects to the portfolio
* Projects cannot exist in more than one portfolio
* Permissions can be more easily managed on indivdidual instances of objects
* New Permissions object primarily applied to portfolios in this release

v0.9.0.dev24+devel
------------------

Version upgrade with braking database changes.

Backup your database before running these migrations.

This is our most exciting release of GovReady-Q!

* Faster loading and launching of Asssessments/questionnaires!
* Simplified install with no subdomains to worry about!
* Replaces subdomain multi-tenancy with simplified "Groups" model!
* Improved authoring tools!
* Streamlined new register,login page!
* Beautiful and helpful new start page!

NOTE: Running the migrations to update the database will perform changes that will prevent rolling back the data migrations.

WIP CHECKLIST

- [ ] Updated documentation
- [ ] Updated tests and test passing
- [ ] Updated changelog and version number

Application changes:

* compliance apps catalog now reads from the database rather than going to remote repositories
The app catalog cache is removed since the page loads much faster.

* Remove multitenancy and subdomains Major UX improvements and convert organizations into groups All pages are served on the same domain.
* Nav bar no longer shows the current organization since pages are no longer organization-specific
* the page at /, when the user is logged out, now shows the old landing domain's homepage instead of the organization-specific homepage, but links around org names (when logged in) are removed because orgs no longer have landing pages
* the projects page now shows projects across all of a user's organizations, various functions that returned resources specific to an organization now don't filter by organization
* the apps catalog, which was organization-specific, now merges the catalogs all all of the organizations that the user is nominally a part of
* if the user is a part of more than one group, the user must choose which group to start an app in 
* Register/login page simplified by putting register and sign in inside a tabs and replacing jumbotron look and feel with minimal sign up and join links.
* User home /project page improved with four getting started actions recommend on what was previously a nearly blank page; replacing "compliance app" terminology with "project" terminology; sleeker table-like display of started projects.
* "Groups" feature to organize and manage related projects (assessments). Goal is to eventually completely replace the previous multi-tenancy Organization feature with a more informal and flexible "Groups" feature. UI uses "groups" terminology while code base currently uses "org_group" terminology to ease transition. Any user can create a group. Group names are global across a GovReady-Q install. Groups provides a folder-like functionality for organizing related projects.
* Navbar improved with displayed links to "Projects" and "Groups"; icons for "Analytics" and "Settings"; removal of dropdown "MENU" item.
* Django messages indicating successful logins/logouts now ignored in base template. Change will hide any Django message of level "Success". Hiding success messages removes the need to dismiss messages or fade them out.
* Preserved original lifecycle interface in template project_lifecycle_original.html
* Create a default org_group slug for user that is username. Test proposed slugs based on username properly report error on name collision with existing org_groups (e.g., a username cannot be created that conflicts with an existing org_group (may want to white list creating of org_groups that are common first names).
* On login errors make signin tab active on page reload to display the errors.

* Add group slug to breadcrumbs for projects, tasks and reduce font size of breadcrumbs. Add group slug to display of project name for clarity. Remove "Component" from breadcrumbs.
* Remove link to legacy organization project in settings page.
* Display username instead of email asddress for user string.
* Use plane lane language for names of top-level questionnaire stage
    columns: To Do, In Progress, Submitted, Approved.

* Better authoring tool:
    - Shift question edit modular dialog from large center screen popup
      to right-hand thin sidebar
    - Increase readability of edit form
    - Insert question into questionnaire
    - Enable editing on questionnaires from all App Sources instead of just "local"
    - Button to view entire questionnaire source YAML
    - TEMPORARY correction of admin access to get tests to run. MUST FIX

Developer changes:

* All apps
* switching language from apps to assessments/questionnaires
* still legacy refrences to organization in source code. org_group language in source code.

* absolute URLs to user-uploaded media now use SITE_ROOT_URL instead of organization subdomains
* the landing domain URLs are moved into the main urlconf (except the ones that were duplicated in both urlconfs because they appeared on both domains)
* revise API URLs to no longer have the organization in the path (we can put it back if it was nice, but it no longer serves a functional purpose)

* AppVersion now has a boolean field for whether the instance should be included in the compliance apps catalog for users to start new projects with that app.
* The AppSource admin now lists all of the apps provided by the source and has links to import new app versions into the database and to see the app versions already in the database by version number.
* When starting a compliance app (i.e. creating a new project), we no longer have to import the app from the remote repository --- instead, we create a new Project and set its root_task to point to a Module in an AppVersion already in the database.
* App loading is refactored in a few places. The routines for getting app catalog information from the remote app data are removed since now we only need it for apps already stored in the database.
* The AppSource admin's approved app lists form is removed since adding apps into the database is now an administrative function and the database column for it is dropped.
* Tests now load into the database the apps they need.
* The app catalog cache is removed since the page loads much faster.

* Organizations now have 'slug' instead of 'subdomain'. get_absolute_url is removed because Organizations have no dedicated pages on the site. get_url is removed because we no longer need complicated logic to form the right absolute URLs to Organization page, since there is no such thing as Organization-specific pages anymore
* remove the Invitation.organization field
* User profile information was previously pre-loaded by the OrganizationSubdomainMiddleware, now it's loaded on first use
* when users register, the email to site admins no longer includes the organization they were looking at when they signed up because there's no such thing anymore
* siteapp.views.new_folder isn't currently in use, so I didn't fully update it to get the new folder's organization from somewhere
* update tests
* remove description of multi-tenant mode and organization subdomains from documentation

* the OrganizationSubdomainMiddleware which checked the subdomain in the request host header, performed Organization-level authorization checks, and set the global request.organization attribute to the requested Organization, is deleted
* the Content Security Policy for the site is updated to remove the white-listed landing domain (we used it for cross-origin requests to get user profile photos, which were always served from the landing domain)
* Django's ALLOWED_HOSTS setting no longer needs an entry for a wildcard subdomain under the landing domain since we are not using that anymore
* the LANDING_DOMAIN, ORGANIZATION_PARENT_DOMAIN, SINGLE_ORGANIZATION_KEY, and REVEAL_ORGS_TO_ANON_USERS attributes on django.conf.settings are removed

* Fix tests to login with new forms in landing page tabs

* Fix various SonarQube reported issues to use preferred HTML tags for stong and em

Deployment changes:

* Removes multi-tenancy and serves all pages from the on the same domain. Previosuly, requests to Q came in on subdomains and the subdomain determined which Organization in the database the request would be associated with and individuals had to re-login across subdomains. Multitenancy increased install complexity and we were not seeing use of the multitenancy feature. Deployment is now simpler.
* Added deployment of multi-container GovReady-Q and NGINX via Docker-compose


v0.8.6.2+devel
--------------
* The AppInstance model/database table was renamed to AppVersion to better reflect the meaning of the model.
* Upgraded some dependencies.


v0.8.6.1 (May 08, 2019)
-----------------------

Deployment changes:

* [Fix] Modified Dockerfile to build MySQL-related libraries into Docker deployment so container would support using MySQL databases out of the box.

v0.8.6 (April 29, 2019)
-----------------------

Application changes:

* Removed "I'll Come Back" and "Unsure" skip buttons that were confusing users. (Data structures retained in database for backward compatability and for possible improved version of indicators.)
* Organization Administrators can now be added within organization Settings by other Organization Administrators.
* Project (e.g., Compliance App) administrators can now be added within Apps settings.
* @ mention any user within discussion regardless of organization or project member instead of @ mentioning only users within the project.
* The compliance apps catalog is now read from compliance apps cached in the database rather than querying local and remote AppSources each time the catalog is loaded or an app is started. A new field is added to the AppVersion (formerly AppInstance) model in the database for whether it should be included in the compliance apps catalog. The AppSource admin's approved apps list table is replaced with a new table showing which compliance apps from the source are already in the compliance apps catalog (or hidden from the catalog but in the database) and which which can be added.

Developer changes:

* Expose rich question metadata within output document templates. Documents can now access if question was skipped by user and skip reason, if question was answered or not, if answer imputed and other goodies.
* Compliance App authors can now remove the skip buttons from displaying on questions by indicating them hidden in the App's `app.yaml` file.

Documentation changes:

* Clearer system requirements discussion.
* Fixed a mis-matched heading in documentation that was causing generated hierarchial table of contents to be malformed.
* Reflowed documentation sections to put deployment instructions earlier and improved structure of deployment instructions.
* Test documentation now includes examples for running individual test Classes and methods.

Deployment changes:

* Split off MySQL-related libraries into a separate pip requirements file so `mysql-config` library would only be required when installing Q with MySQL.
* Upgraded  dependencies.
* The AppInstance model/database table was renamed to AppVersion to better reflect the meaning of the model.
* Upgraded some dependencies.

v0.8.5 (February 9, 2019)
-------------------------

Application changes:

* An undocumented feature called "unskippable questions" was removed. This feature inadvertently hid some questions, resulting in a module being indicated as finished but its progress bar showing questions are unfinished.

Deployment changes:

* GovReady-Q can now be deployed behind an enterprise reverse proxy authentication server that sends login information in HTTP headers.
* Python 3.6+ is now required.
* Documentation was added for creating a custom Docker image that adds organization branding to the site.

Developer changes:

* Add a new VERSION file to source code control that stores the current version of the software, plus a commit hash for public releases, so that nightly builds don't fail because of a missing VERSION file. Add build tests to ensure the VERSION file matches the top release in CHANGELOG.md and ends with "+devel" if and only if this is a development release.
* The application was not working on macOS in version v0.8.4 because of a bug in commonmark 0.8.0.
* Some of the templates were split out into multiple files to make it easier to override them for custom branding.
* Upgraded some dependencies.

v0.8.4 (October 23, 2018)
-------------------------

Application changes:

* "Invite Colleague" on the home page now is always displayed instead of being hidden in some cases.
* The "Related Controls" button on project pages is back now as "Documents."

App authoring changes:

* Output document templates can now be stored in separate files rather than all output document templates being stored in the module YAML file.

Other changes:

* A new command-line tool called "assemble" is available that instantiates an entire project from a YAML file of app selections and question answers and generates/saves output documents to files on disk.
* Add system minimum and recommended software requirements to documentation.
* Version 0.8.3 skipped.

Developer changes:

* Non-cryptographic hash functions replace cryptographic hash functions in places where a cryptographic hash function is not necessary and might be excessively slow.
* Other minor fixes.

----------------------

Application changes:

* Javascript and CSS static assets of compliance apps may have had the wrong MIME type set.

App authoring changes:

*  The authoring tool is updated to show app catalog and other app-module YAML in two textareas instead of one, since they are now stored separately in the database (see below), but they are recombined when the authoring tool updates local files.
* A new `version-name` field is added to app.yaml catalog information.

Deployment changes:

* The HTTP Content-Security-Policy header is now set to prevent browsers from loading any third-party assets.
* A CentOS 7-based Vagrantfile has been added to the source distribution for those looking to deploy using a VM.
* Added some outputs to Docker launches to see the Q version and the container user during build and at the very start of container startup.
* We're now publishing version tags to Docker Hub so that past versions of GovReady-Q remain available when we publish a new release.
* With Docker, email environment variable settings were ignored since the last (-rc3) release.

Developer changes:

* The AppInstance table now has created and updated datetime columns, version_number and version_name columns extracted from the catalog metadata, and a new catalog_metadata field that holds the original YAML 'catalog' information (but in JSON in the database; this information was previously in the 'app' Module's spec field).
* The ModuleAssetPack table is dropped and its columns have been moved to the AppInstance table.
* Code refactoring: split module_sources.py into two modules.
* Upgraded some dependencies.
