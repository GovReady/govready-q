GovReady-Q Release Notes
========================

v0.9.12-dev (September xx, 2021)
--------------------------------

**Developer changes**

* Update .gitattributes configuration for EOL character for cross-platform development.


v0.9.11 (September 18, 2021)
----------------------------

IMPORTANT BREAKING CHANGE

This release replaces questionnaire-style account settings (e.g., user profile) with traditional user information form.

**Installing this release will reset all users display names, titles, and profile pics.**

**Please contact info@govready.com for a free, custom fix to preserve this data if desired!!**

Display names will be reset to the username, title set to blank, and profile pics set to blank.

We apologize for not being able to find a practical, transparent solution to preserve existing display name
and photos during this change. We think the short term pain of resetting of this information at each user's convenience
is better than a complicated attempt to coordinate every install through a fragile, sequence-dependent, multi-version upgrade process.

Until now, user profile information was set by gathering information via our questionnaire feature.
We thought that was cool, but turned out to be overly complex to support. Having a traditional account
settings feature provides for better extensibility and easier use. We've been wanting to make this change for a while.

**Feature changes**

* Replace questionnaire-style account settings (e.g., user profile) with traditional user information form.
* Add a set of default headers (through hidden inputs and a html form) for the SSP CSV export, dubbed Quick CSV.
* Add makecmmcstatements admin command to create library component statements with CMMC content based on existing content.
* Create RemoteStatement model in controls to better track relationship between statements created from other statements.
* Add `change_log` field to maintain more accessible history of changes made to statement.
* Fixed Selenium to run properly in visbile mode while using Docker. Includes changes to `environment.json`
* GovReady-q container name changed from `govready_q_dev` to `govready-q-dev` in all commands.

**UI changes**

* A Quick CSV button on the system security plan page.

**Bug fix**

* Correctly handle exporting library components when component has zero statements to avoid crashing exportcomponentlibrary command.
* Add execute permissions to `/dev_env/docker/remote_interpreter/python_env.sh b/dev_env/docker/remote_interpreter/python_env.sh`
* Fix control group titles not showing up in properly in generated SSPs.
* Replace common Unicode characters in generated SSPs (e.g. smart apostrophe, bullets).

**Developer changes**

Change in `environment.json` to better support visible Selenium tests will require deleting current containers and artifacts for local development. On next launch, run:
```
cd dev_env
rm docker/environment.json
python run.py wipedb
python run.py init
python run.py dev
```

NOTE: GovReady-q container name changed from `govready_q_dev` to `govready-q-dev`.

* Add "actions" to Compliance App questions (e.g., tasks) that are conditionally performed based on question answer(s).
* Add "roles" to identify, organize, and process system elements (e.g., components)

The add action capability is supported by new `actions` item within each defined question.

Actions take the form:

```
  actions:
    - value: <answer_value>
      action: <object>/<verb>/<filter>
      comment: <comment>
```

Example actions:

```
  actions:
    - value: adfs
      action: element/add_role/ADFS
      comment: Add elements assigned AFDS to selected components
    - value: adfs
      action: element/del_role/Azure Active Directory
      comment: Delete elements assigned Azure Active Directory from selected components
```

The following actions are currently supported:

1. `system/assign_baseline/<value>` - Automatically sets the system baseline controls to the selected impact
2. `system/update_system_and_project_name/<value>` - Automatically sets the system, project names
3. `element/add_role/<role_value>` - Automatically add elements to the selected components of a system
4. `element/del_role/<role_value>` - Automatically delete elements from the selected components of a system

- Actions are (currently) performed as part of the processing question answer in guidedmodules, before going to next question.
- Actions should be idempotent.
- Actions almost never re-direct user out of the questionnaire.
- Actions need to be reversible. When a user changes an answer previous action should be undone or modified accordingly.

We connect actions defined in the portable compliance app to GovReady-Q instance data via "roles" dynamically assigned to target objects.
In the initially supported use case, Elements can be assiged Roles via new `ElementRole` model.
The new `ElementRole` model assigns roles to system elements via a Many-to-Many relationship.
ElementRoles and associating Elements to roles is currently be done in Django admin interface.

Roles provide a level of abstraction between an action defined in compliance app and actual objects dynamically assign that role.

ElementRoles also enables categorizing, organizing, filtering, and creating checks around Elements. An example roles might be "internal-only" to make allow checks to be added to prevent accidental disclore.

ElementsRoles differ from more generic tags because the setting of roles should be limited to privileged users and have specific organizational purpose.

Current limitations:
- No tests.
- ElementRoles and Element assignment to roles must be done in Djang admin interface.
- Adding component is done through questionnaire, but if component deleted question does not yet know or update. Need to be able to clear question.
- No handling yet of marking a question unanswered.
- No logging yet of action result to question history.
- Code needs optimization and DRY-ness.
- Roles need to be created manually in the GovReady-Q instance for a compliance app using actions with roles. In the future, when a compliance app is loaded the roles could be created automically. An privileged would still need to assign local elements to roles.

**UI changes**

* Provide messaging feedback when answering a question triggers an action.

**Data changes**

* Added speedysp to q-files' govready-q-files-startpack to demonstrate how fast an SSP can be made.

**Install changes**

* Rename installed sample project to clearly indicate project is sample data.

v0.9.1.50.2 (January 26, 2021)
------------------------------

Adds support for OSCAL component and statement input for Compliance Apps.
(Currently only supports OSCAL JSON inputs.)
Adds statements to project upon project creation.
Keeps track of app inputs by relating them to the app version.

Includes the following schema update to the app.yaml file of Compliance Apps.
Inputs are supported in the app.yaml file with the following format:

```
input:
- id: <input_id> (string)
  name: <Input Name> (string)
  type: oscal (Only oscal currently supported)
  path: <dir/filename.json> (relative file path)
  group: (optional string)
```

Add deployments to capture system deployments and the inventory items in each deployment.
One system has multiple deployments (e.g., dev, stage, prod) and each deployment contains an inventory of the actual endpoints/items in a deployment of the system. Systems start with several common default (empty) deployments.
The "design" deployment by convention is a special deployment to represent the system architecture.
Deployments maintain a complete version history.
Deployment inventory-items are represented as JSON data object following a scheme that is similar to OSCAL inventory-item section.
Data for deployment inventory-items is assumed to be generated outside of GovReady. It is critical that the inventory items have UUIDs prior to import. Inventory item UUIDs for the life of the instantiated inventory item.
Inventory items in an deployment can be associated with an inventory item in the "design" deployment by referencing the "design" inventory item's UUID. This enablea a virtual persistence of an inventory-item across different instances of the "same" assest, such as a virtual database server.

**Feature changes**

v0.9.1.48 (December 15, 2020)
------------------------------

Add Component Library feature pages and improve UI for managing reuse and "certified" component library.

Properly generate JSON, YAML questionnaire output documents from a JSON (or YAML) output template in the compliance app `output` section. The JSON, YAML output documents are first converted to Python data structures and then populated with information in a variant of Jinja2 substitutions.

Fix tests so they execute successfully in CircleCI.

**Feature changes**

* Support Compliance As Code reuse of statements via "certified" control sets. This capability is enabled by adding having statements sub-typed to `control_implementation_prototype` to support local statements sub-typed to `control_implementation` and `control_implementation_prototype` with the latter representing the "certified" version of a component-control element.  Every `control_implementation` statement type was given a Django foreign key called `prototype` to connect that statement to the "certified" version of the control (e.g., `control_implementation_prototype`). This model supports the features in the UI:

1. Add a component to the system while on components page via autocomplete and create `control_implementation` statements from the `control_implementation_prototype` statements
1. Add a component to the system while on control edit page via autocomplete and create `control_implementation` statements from the `control_implementation_prototype` statements
1. Notify user that the local statement for a component-control (e.g., `control_implementation`) was different than the "certified" statement for the component-control (e.g., `control_implementation_prototype`).
1. Enable viewer to view differences between a component-control (e.g., `control_implementation`) was different than the "certified" statement for the component-control (e.g., `control_implementation_prototype`).
1. To update a "certified" statement, enable an administrator to update (e.g. push) the "certified" statement for the component-control (e.g., `control_implementation_prototype`) text from the a systems' component-control (e.g., `control_implementation`) text.
1. After a "certified" statement was updated, enable user to copy (e.g. pull) the updated "certified" statement for the component-control (e.g., `control_implementation_prototype`) text into other systems' a component-control (e.g., `control_implementation`) text.

* Support generation of JSON, YAML questionnaire output documents with Jinja2 style substitutions, loops, and conditionals. Re-do the 'json' template format to recognize a new %for control structure objects that execute loops.

* Support generation of Word DOCX questionnaire output documents with page numbers, headers, footers, TOC (using pandoc custom reference doc feature).

* Support creating a new component in the library.

**UI changes**

* Add Component Library page listing all available components.
* Add global navbar link to Component Library.
* Remove Common Control tab from control editor.
* Remove redundent listing of control statements from component description tab.
* Display filler text when component does not have a description.
* Move component implementation statement tab to left of combined statement tab in control editor.
* Updating certified text also updates the HTML block showing the certified text with updated certified text on edit pages.
* Add components (system elements) via an autocomplete to a system on system's selected components page.
* Add label/alert above implementation statement edit box when notifying user if local system statement is synchronized with certified control implementation statement.
* Make statement synchronization status lable/alert clickable to reveal certified statement and diff between local and certified.
* Add buttons for copying certified statement into local statement and for admin to update certified statement from local statement.
* Add autocompletes to make it easy to add a new component to a system and the component's respective certified controls.
* Use Select2 box to add component to system's selected component.
* Add route `add_system_component` and related view to add a component to a system's selected component.
* Replace the url pattern routing in v0.9.1.46.4 for directing accounts login to home page with custom templates to override default aullauth templates.
* Use Django messaging when adding a component to system's selected component to provide user with better feedback.

**Data changes**

* Add `copy` method to `Element` data model to create a new element (e.g. component) as a copy of existing component.
* Add `statements` method to `Element` data model to produce a list of statements of a particular `statement_type`.
* Add default Organizational Defined Parameter values in `controls/data/org_defined_parameters`.

**Bug fixes**

* Fix multiple loadings of updated `smt.body` into bootstrap's panel heading section by improved naming of div classes in panel and better targeted update.
* Fix enable_experimental_oscal control. Model method was set incorrectly requiring both enable_experimental_oscal and enable_experimental_opencontrol had to be enabled for either to show up.
* Fix testing issues. Fix tests so they execute successfully in CircleCI.

**Developer changes**

* Default Selenium tests to headless mode. Add new `test_visible` parameter option for `local/environment.json` to force Selenium tests to run in visible or headless mode.
Add `custom-reference.docx` MS Word DOCX document to `/assets` directory to be used by pandoc when generating MS Word output documents in order to provide page numbers, headers, footers, TOC.
* Significantly refactored indentations in control edtor pages to make code folding and div analysis easier.
* Add an ElementForm to create new components (AKA Elements).
* Modified controls.Statement model to link `control_implementation` statements to
  `control_implementation_prototype` statements. See commit 5083af.
* Add methods for diff'ing (e.g., comparing) a `control_implementation` statement against its prototype statement using Google diff-match-patch.
* Avoid duplicative adding of a component to a system causing duplicate statements.
* Avoiding adding a component with no control implementation statements to a system.
* Add all available control implementation statements of a component to a system, even for controls that are not selected controls.
* Avoid adding duplicate control implementation instance statements to a system by checking in the statement model that we are not creating an instance statement when such and statement from prototype already exists.
* Use Django messaging when adding a component to system's selected component to provide user with better feedback.
* Delete already commented-out contol id look up from system's selected components page.
* The work for a component library and certified controls was performed across three branches that were eventually synchronized (approximately commit 18934669) and merged into the master branch:
    * `autocomplete_statements_#1066`
    * `ge/reuse-0903`
    * `automated-tests-statements`

Under development output document formats `oscal_json`, `oscal_yaml`,
and `oscal_xml` are now replaced with `json`, `yaml`, and `xml` respectively.

Format `xml` still under development and not recommended for regular use.

Formats for `json` and `yaml` now support new Jinja2-like tags to enable
parameter substituion and loops inside those formats while Django handles
them as Python objects:

```
%for
%loop

%if
%then

{{ param }}
```

Example:

```
{ "title" : "{{project.system_info.system_name}}",
"published" : "2020-07-01T00:00:00.00-04:00",
"last-modified" : "2020-07-01T00:00:00.00-04:00",
"version" : "0.0",
"oscal-version" : "1.0-Milestone3",
"new-control-stuff": {
  "%for": "control in system.root_element.selected_controls_oscal_ctl_ids",
  "%loop": {
    "%if": "control.lower() in control_catalog",
    "%then":  {
      "uuid": "{{ system.control_implementation_as_dict[control]['elementcontrol_uuid'] }}",
      "control-id": "{{ control.lower() }}",
      "by-component": {
        "%for": "smt in system.control_implementation_as_dict[control]['control_impl_smts']",
        "%loop": {
          "key": "{{ smt.producer_element.uuid }}",
          "value": { "uuid" : "{{ smt.uuid }}",
            "component-name": "{{   smt.producer_element.name|safe }}",
            "description" : "{{ smt.body|safe }}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

v0.9.1.22.8 (June 12, 2020)
---------------------------

**Deployment fix**

* Remove conflict leading to infinite redirects when terminating SSL at a reverse proxy caused by SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT being set to `True` in `settings.py` telling Django to also redirect insecure `https` connections on the same server. Introduces optional new `secure_ssl_redirect`
parameter setting for `local/enviornment.json` file for deployments where Django redirect should be used. See: https://github.com/GovReady/govready-q/issues/934.

# Force Django to redirect non-secure SSL connections to secure ssl connections
# NOTE: Setting to True while simultaneously using a http proxy like NGINX
#       that is also redirecting can lead to infinite redirects.
#       See: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#secure-ssl-redirect
#       SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT is False by default.

* Because we are still working on better extraction of data from questionnaires, create links in the Selected Control page to assign a baseline when none exists.
* Added new `assign_baseline` method to System object to assign
controls that are part of baseline to the selected controls of
a system root element.
* Comment out polling on the task_finished page to lower noise in log.

**Data changes**

* Correct an control_id typo in NIST 800-53 rev moderate baseline

---------------------------

**Bug fix**

* Fix bug causing the starting of apps as answers to modules to fail. Reset start app form to pass a GET instead of a post to correctly pass question parameter to store.


v0.9.1.22.4 (June 09, 2020)
---------------------------

**UI changes**

* Added refresh icon to output documents to let user force refresh of output document. Useful for refreshing SSPs after implementation statements have changed.

v0.9.1.22.3 (June 07, 2020)
---------------------------

**Feature changes**

This version integrates the new implementation statements
stored in GovReady-Q's database into the Output Docs.

The implementation statements are accessed via a new `{{ system }}`
object. The `system` object provides access to the component-to-control
implementation statements that we began storing as distinct database
objects in version 0.9.1.5 of GovReady-Q.

The `system` object is injected into the Output Document context as
an item in guidedmodules.module_logic. NOTE: if the context from
the view already has a `system` item, it will not be overwritten.

Exactly one Information System associated with the project (if one exists).

The key attribute of `system` object is `control_implementation_as_dict`
containing a dictionary of all implementations statements and common controls
for a system.

    {
      "au-2": {
                "control_impl_smts": [smt_obj_1, smt_obj_2],
                "common_controls": [common_control_obj_1, common_control_obj_2],
                "combined_smt": "Very long text combining statements into a single string..."
              },
      "au-3": {
                "control_impl_smts": [smt_obj_3, smt_obj_4, ...],
                "common_controls": [],
                "combined_smt": "Very long text combining statements into a single string..."
              },
      ...
    }

**Documentation changes**

* Add initial documentation describing the `{{ system }}` object and the previously created `{{ control_catalog }}` object.

v0.9.1.22.2 (June 07, 2020)
---------------------------

**Deployment changes**

CRITICAL fix for deployment documentation and configuration files.

* Remove all comments from `supervisor-govready-q.conf ` because trailing "# comments" cause line to be ignored. This caused a problem in Ubuntu deployment documentation leading to a situation where gunicorn was starting in wrong context and python packages not found.
* Improved `settings.py` handling of deprecated `host` and `https` parameters for setting `SITE_ROOT_URL` value.


v0.9.1.22 (June 05, 2020)
------------------------

**Feature changes**

Improve application logging. Add `structlog` library. Log permission escalations.
See documentation for a description of the event log formats.
The following logged events have been added:

"update_permissions portfolio assign_owner_permissions" - assign portfolio owner permissions
"update_permissions portfolio remove_owner_permissions" - remove portfolio owner permissions
"portfolio_list" - view list of portfolios
"new_portfolio" - create new portfolio
"new_portfolio assign_owner_permissions" - assign portfolio owner permissions of newly created portfolio to creator
"send_invitation portfolio assign_edit_permissions" - assign portfolio edit permissions of newly created portfolio to creator
"send_invitation project assign_edit_permissions" - assign edit permissions to a project and send invitation
"cancel_invitation" - cancel invitation to a project
"accept_invitation" - accept invitation to a project
"sso_logout" - Single Sign On logout
"project_list" - vew list of projects
"start_app" - start a questionnaire/compliance app
"new_project" - create a new project (e.g., questionnaire/compliance app that is a project)
"new_element new_system" - create a new element (e.g., system component) that represents a new system

**Deployment changes**

* Update name of git 2 CentOS package to git222 in Dockerfile.

**Documentation changes**

* Added documentation section on logging.

v0.9.1.20 (May 31, 2020)
------------------------

**Documentation changes**

* Re-wrote Ubuntu from Source instructions to explain deployment in much greater detail.
* Extend Ubuntu from Source instructions to include Gunicorn, Supervisor, and NGINX
* Created sets of exammple configuration files in ``local-examples`` to make deployment eaiser.

**Deployment changes**

* Introduce the ``govready_url`` environment parameter as a replacement for multiple params of ``host``, ``port``, and ``https``. During transition period ``govready-url`` parameter overrides any setting of ``host``, ``port``, and ``https`` parameters. Example below shows the ``local/environment.json`` file using the single ``govready-url`` parameter replacing legacy parameters:

```
    # Preferred local/environment.json file using govready-url parameter

    {
      "db": "mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/NAME",
      "govready-url": "http://localhost:8000",
      "debug": false,
      "secret-key": "long_random_string_here",
      ...
    }


    # Legacy version local/environment.json file using deprecated host, https parameter

    {
       "db": "mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/NAME",
       "host": "localhost:8000",
       "https": false,
       "debug": false,
       "secret-key": "long_random_string_here",
       ...
    }
```

* Created sets of exammple configuration files in ``local-examples`` to make deployment eaiser.
* The ``install-govready-q.sh`` script now reads the ``govready-url`` parameter from ``local/environment.json`` and uses the values to start GovReady-Q on the indicated host and port.

v.0.9.1.19 (June 02, 2020)
-------------------------

**UI Changes**

* Intially collapse component controls so it is easier see all components.
* Add full text of implementation statement to accordian panel header to make it easier to read controls.
* Create routes and templates for displaying components (e.g., elements) associated with a system.

------------------------

**Documentation changes:**

* Ubuntu from source installation docs updated to include upgrading pip to solve problem of Ubuntu's defualt pip not installing Python packages under Linux user installs.

v0.9.1.17 (May 29, 2020)
------------------------

**UX changes:**

Performance improvements to improve rendering questions faster.

A major change in this commit is to create a cache for Jinja `expression_compile` routine.
This new cache is `jinja2_expression_compile_cache` and seems to have a noticable improvement
on maintaining a regular amount of time to render questions.

Several page reloads were the result of page redirects being handled
based on content of the next page inside the question save form. Calculating the next page
to display while accounting for skipping computed pages is now handled server side as a function
that can be called.

Removed links to imputed pages from the module finished page. It does not make sense to
link to imputed questions when users cannot visit imputed question pages.

Improve caching of OSCAL control catalogs.

v.0.9.1.16 (May 18, 2020)
-------------------------

**Development changes**

* Correct setup of tests in discussions app to avoid failing due to missing system modules.

v.0.9.1.15 (May 18, 2020)
-------------------------

**Deployment changes**

* Set gunicorn worker number to 1. Multiple gunicorn workers without SECRET_KEY set causes issue where new session key is autogenerated, sent user, and user has to constantly re-login.

v.0.9.1.14 (May 17, 2020)
-------------------------

**Deployment changes**

* Update deployment/docker/first_run.sh script to accept and pass along `--non-interactive` flag.
* Create install-govready-q.sh script (based on quickstart.sh) to have an easy single script for installing GovReady-Q.
* Update Dockerfile to copy over new install-govready-q.sh script and quickstart.sh script.
* Use docker_container_run.sh script in instructions for installing in the cloud.

**Documentation changes**

* Improvements to docker install, installation guides.
* Improve sequencing of install steps in Ubuntu. Apply improved improved squence to installing on CentOS guide.
* Breakout installation guide for Docker guides into "local", "cloud" and "advanced configuration options".

v.0.9.1.13 (May 17, 2020)
-------------------------

**Bug fixes**

* Correct control look up errors on the control catalog group page.
* Remove control lookup from catalog listing page.

v.0.9.1.12 (May 16, 2020)
-------------------------

**Deployment changes**

v.0.9.1.11 (May 11, 2020)
-------------------------

**Deployment changes**

Add docker compose file for deploying GovReady and Wazuh together.

v0.9.1.10 (May 10, 2020)
------------------------

**Feature changes**

Add in baselines listings for 800-53 Rev 4 (low, moderate, high) and 800-171 Rev 1.

Assigning baselines only available from Django commandline shell at momement (no UI).

**Documentation changes**

v0.9.1.9 (May 08, 2020)
-----------------------

v0.9.1.8.2 (May 10, 2020)
-------------------------

Update Documentation. Organization installation documentation inside of `Installation Guide` directory.
Clean up singe pages for installation notes on each Operating System flavor.
Rename 0.9.0 mentions to 0.9.x. Remove installation instructions from 0.9.x directory.

v0.9.1.9 (May 08, 2020)
-----------------------

Add export to Xacta Control Implementation Excel file format.

v0.9.1.8.1 (May 07, 2020)
-------------------------

Add export to Xacta Control Implementation Excel file format.
Add full draft of 800-171_rev1_catalog.json in OSCAL.

v0.9.1.8 (May 06, 2020)
-----------------------

Create new projects and systems in pairs. When a Project is created by adding a
questionnaire (e.g., compliance app) from the store, create the linked System, too.

Projects and systems are now also given a unique name via the appending of the
project's unique ID to the name.

**Developer changes**

When a root Project App object is added from the store automatically
create the Project's linked System object consisting of a Element object
and a System object with the Element as the System's root_element.

When user updates the Project name, also update the name of the
System's root_element to keep names synchronized.

In the future as the store expands, more tests might be needed to
make sure only certain top level apps are creating systems. Right now
we use the existing tests of adding a Project to the "Started Apps"
folder as indication the Project is a top level app requiring a system.


v0.9.1.7 (May 02, 2020)
-----------------------

PDF generation and thumbnails are turned off by default for
security reasons. Change PDF and custom thumbnail generation for uploaded
files to optional. Require Admins to separately install the `wkhtmltopdf` library.

PDF generator library ``wkhtmltopdf`` has security issues wherein individuals could add
HTML references such as links or file references inside the documents
they are creating which the PDF Generator blindly interprets. This leads
to SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) in which data is retrieved from
server and added to PDF by the PDF Generator. An issue also exists
with the sub-dependency of `libxslt` before CentOS 8.x raising CVE vulnerability
with scanners. For these reasons, PDF Generation is now a configurable setting.

v0.9.1.6 (April 29, 2020)
-------------------------

Continue to improve control editor.

Enforce unique Name field on Element model.
Match Component (Producer Element) by unique name to existing
Producer Element in the database when creating a new Statement.

Improve the combining of component statements.
Temporarily put result into a textarea to make easier to copy manually.

v0.9.1.5 (April 21, 2020)
-------------------------

Build on control catalog search to begin to represent
controls in the database for each system.

Control Guidance using OSCAL (#833)

* Small metadata changes to models

* Add 800-53 control catalog to output templates

First effort to add control catalogs (e.g., control guidance)
to the output templates using OSCAL and to create an editor
for adding and editing control statements stored in the database.

Initial user story is as a user/developer wanting to import
a spreadsheet of common controls to have a better interface for
reading the common controls against the control statement and
drafting the application layer controls for hybrid controls.
The user wants an easier way to do this than a spreadsheet because
spreadsheets are hard to read.

Begin a parser library to have code to input variously formatted
source material into the database.

** Developer changes **

Replace SecControl library and parsing older XML version
of 800-53 catalog with pure python parsing of modern
OSCAL version of catalogs.

We also add a new item type to module_logic.TemplateContext called
`control_catalog`. When includeing `{{control_catalog}}` in output
template we now have access to a dictionary of controls where
each control is listed as a dictionary.

Create a new script `oscal.py` and a `Catalog` class
and create look ups of controls.

Because OSCAL is hierarchical and recursive, we also generate
a flattened, simplified version of our control catalog.

* Add simple CommonControl model

Add simple CommonControl and CommonControlProvider models.

We are creating CommonControl model as first step to being able
to manage control implementation statements in GovReady.

We also want a way to import CommonControls into GovReady database.

We create `CliControlImporter` as first cut tool for reading
an excel spreadsheet with xlrd, converting the rows to simple
control object and importing into the database. Code snippets
included. Class and snippets only work for one spreadsheet format,
but some abstraction exists to make customization easier for other
formats.

Refactor implementation editor to use panels and have
interactivity for adding additional implementation statements
using Boostrap 3.3. panel model.

In models, sketch out the "statement" model for implementation attestations
but leave commented out for present.

Add Ajax calls to save implementation statements

This commit puts in the Django and Javascript to save a statement
to the server via Ajax.

Each implementation statement panel and form is given a unique id
when added to the page to make sure the correct statment information
is passed to the server.

When component name is updated, the panel title updates.

Add hidden fields to send the control id and the system name as part
of the form.

[WIP] Add utility class to parse statements with tagged elements

Create utility `StatementParser_TaggedTextWithElementsInBrackets` class
to parse collection of statements in a text file with serially listed
controls where control ids and elements are enclosed in brackets.

The idea is that common controls or other controls can be extracted
and put into a long text file separated by control ids. Brackets are put around
proper entities (e.g., system "elements") that mentioned in the implementation
statement. By identifying system elements, it is possible to build a basic
entity identification tool and create a specific listing of elements involved
in each implementation statement. This is an initial step to create
component-to-control mappings.

* Goal is to save statement of whatever length and list of system elements
  involved with process
* Ignore multiple intervening lines
* System name must be entered manually
* Script makes one pass to build search dictionary with bracketed strings
  then uses dictionary to find all instances of strings in statements.
  This makes it unnecessary to place all instances of elements regardless of brackets.

Like other parse and import utility classes, this basic code may need modifications
for specific situations.

* Add Statement, Element models; Save implementation statements

This commits finishes work started in commit 4e77ba531069832d0a2507ebfd32a0e41f2bf8df

This commit adds Statement and Element models as the core feature
to track component-to-control statements. The more general terms of
"Statement" and "Element" are used instead of "Control"and "Component".

An "implementation statement" is a statement (and attestation).

A many to many relationship is supported for Statements and Elements.

This commit finishes in the Django and Javascript to save a statement
to the server via Ajax.

To Do:
- Delete statements
- Tests written


v0.9.1.4 (April 08, 2020)
-------------------------

This release exposes control catalog to end users for search.

Previously versions embedded controls within output templates.

**UI changes**

* Create new `control` pages for looking up control catalog guidance.

**Developer changes**

* Add 800-53 control catalog via classes `SecControlsAll` and `SecControl`

* Django messages indicating successful logins/logouts now ignored in base template. Change will hide any Django message of level "Success". Hiding success messages removes the need to dismiss messages or fade them out.

**Developer changes**

*Organization related*

* The OrganizationSubdomainMiddleware which checked the subdomain in the request host header, performed Organization-level authorization checks, and set the global request.organization attribute to the requested Organization, is deleted.
* the Content Security Policy for the site is updated to remove the white-listed landing domain (we used it for cross-origin requests to get user profile photos, which were always served from the landing domain)
* Django's ALLOWED_HOSTS setting no longer needs an entry for a wildcard subdomain under the landing domain since we are not using that anymore.
* The LANDING_DOMAIN, ORGANIZATION_PARENT_DOMAIN, SINGLE_ORGANIZATION_KEY, and REVEAL_ORGS_TO_ANON_USERS attributes on django.conf.settings are removed.
* Update tests for organizational removal.
* Remove description of multi-tenant mode and organization subdomains from documentation.
* siteapp.views.new_folder isn't currently in use, so did not fully update related code to get the new folder's organization from somewhere.
* Starting to switching language from apps to assessments/questionnaires.
* Beware of legacy references to organization in source code. Still cleaning up removal of multitenancy and subdomains.
* Absolute URLs to user-uploaded media now use SITE_ROOT_URL instead of organization subdomains.
* The landing domain URLs are moved into the main urlconf (except the ones that were duplicated in both urlconfs because they appeared on both domains).
* Revise API URLs to no longer have the organization in the path (we can put it back if it was nice, but it no longer serves a functional purpose).
* Remove the Invitation.organization field.

*Questionnaire related*

* AppVersion now has a boolean field for whether the instance should be included in the compliance apps catalog for users to start new projects with that app.
* The AppSource admin now lists all of the apps provided by the source and has links to import new app versions into the database and to see the app versions already in the database by version number.
* When starting a compliance app (i.e. creating a new project), we no longer have to import the app from the remote repository --- instead, we create a new Project and set its root_task to point to a Module in an AppVersion already in the database.
* App loading is refactored in a few places. The routines for getting app catalog information from the remote app data are removed since now we only need it for apps already stored in the database.
* The AppSource admin's approved app lists form is removed since adding apps into the database is now an administrative function and the database column for it is dropped.
* Tests now load into the database the apps they need.
* The app catalog cache is removed since the page loads much faster.

* User profile information was previously pre-loaded by the OrganizationSubdomainMiddleware, now it's loaded on first use.
* When users register, the email to site admins no longer includes the organization they were looking at when they signed up because there's no such thing anymore.
* Fix tests to login with new forms in landing page tabs

*Miscellaneous*

* Fix various SonarQube reported issues to use preferred HTML tags for stong and em
* Testmocking scripts for populating test data into application.

**Deployment changes**

* Remove multi-tenancy and serves all pages from the on the same domain. Previosuly, requests to Q came in on subdomains and the subdomain determined which Organization in the database the request would be associated with and individuals had to re-login across subdomains. Multitenancy increased install complexity and we were not seeing use of the multitenancy feature. Deployment is now simpler.
* Add deployment scripts of multi-container GovReady-Q and NGINX via Docker-compose.
* Prevent multiple notification emails in environments running multiple Q instances against single database by performing record lock on notification and checking if notification already sent.
* `first_run` reports if Superuser previously created.
* Added check to `dockerfile_exec.sh` to prevent unintended 0.9.0 databse upgrades.


v0.8.6.2+devel
--------------

-----------------------

Application changes:

* Removed "I'll Come Back" and "Unsure" skip buttons that were confusing users. (Data structures retained in database for backward compatability and for possible improved version of indicators.)
* Organization Administrators can now be added within organization Settings by other Organization Administrators.
* Project (e.g., Compliance App) administrators can now be added within Apps settings.
* @ mention any user within discussion regardless of organization or project member instead of @ mentioning only users within the project.
* The compliance apps catalog is now read from compliance apps cached in the database rather than querying local and remote AppSources each time the catalog is loaded or an app is started. A new field is added to the AppVersion (formerly AppInstance) model in the database for whether it should be included in the compliance apps catalog. The AppSource admin's approved apps list table is replaced with a new table showing which compliance apps from the source are already in the compliance apps catalog (or hidden from the catalog but in the database) and which which can be added.

Developer changes:

* Expose rich question metadata within output document templates. Documents can now access if question was skipped by user and skip reason, if question was answered or not, if answer imputed and other goodies.
* Compliance App authors can now remove the skip buttons from displaying on questions by indicating them hidden in the App's `app.yaml` file.

Documentation changes:

* Python 3.6+ is now required.
* Documentation was added for creating a custom Docker image that adds organization branding to the site.

Developer changes:

* Add a new VERSION file to source code control that stores the current version of the software, plus a commit hash for public releases, so that nightly builds don't fail because of a missing VERSION file. Add build tests to ensure the VERSION file matches the top release in CHANGELOG.md and ends with "+devel" if and only if this is a development release.
* The application was not working on macOS in version v0.8.4 because of a bug in commonmark 0.8.0.

----------------------

Application changes:

* Javascript and CSS static assets of compliance apps may have had the wrong MIME type set.

App authoring changes:

*  The authoring tool is updated to show app catalog and other app-module YAML in two textareas instead of one, since they are now stored separately in the database (see below), but they are recombined when the authoring tool updates local files.
* A new `version-name` field is added to app.yaml catalog information.

Deployment changes:

* The HTTP Content-Security-Policy header is now set to prevent browsers from loading any third-party assets.
* A CentOS 7-based Vagrantfile has been added to the source distribution for those looking to deploy using a VM.
* Added some outputs to Docker launches to see the Q version and the container user during build and at the very start of container startup.
* We're now publishing version tags to Docker Hub so that past versions of GovReady-Q remain available when we publish a new release.
* With Docker, email environment variable settings were ignored since the last (-rc3) release.

Developer changes:

* The AppInstance table now has created and updated datetime columns, version_number and version_name columns extracted from the catalog metadata, and a new catalog_metadata field that holds the original YAML 'catalog' information (but in JSON in the database; this information was previously in the 'app' Module's spec field).
* The ModuleAssetPack table is dropped and its columns have been moved to the AppInstance table.
* Code refactoring: split module_sources.py into two modules.
* Upgraded some dependencies.
