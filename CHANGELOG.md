GovReady-Q Release Notes
========================

In Development
--------------

Developer changes:

* Upgraded some dependencies.
* Split off MySQL-related modules into a separate requirements file for pip. This means that `mysql-config` is no longer required for installing Q without MySQL.

v0.8.5 (February 9, 2019)
-------------------------

Application changes:

* An undocumented feature called "unskippable questions" was removed. This feature inadvertently hid some questions, resulting in a module being indicated as finished but its progress bar showing questions are unfinished.

Deployment changes:

* GovReady-Q can now be deployed behind an enterprise reverse proxy authentication server that sends login information in HTTP headers.
* Python 3.6+ is now required.
* Documentation was added for creating a custom Docker image that adds organization branding to the site.

Developer changes:

* Add a new VERSION file to source code control that stores the current version of the software, plus a commit hash for public releases, so that nightly builds don't fail because of a missing VERSION file. Add build tests to ensure the VERSION file matches the top release in CHANGELOG.md and ends with "+devel" if and only if this is a development release.
* The application was not working on macOS in version v0.8.4 because of a bug in commonmark 0.8.0.
* Some of the templates were split out into multiple files to make it easier to override them for custom branding.
* Upgraded some dependencies.

v0.8.4 (October 23, 2018)
-------------------------

Application changes:

* "Invite Colleague" on the home page now is always displayed instead of being hidden in some cases.
* The "Related Controls" button on project pages is back now as "Documents."

App authoring changes:

* Output document templates can now be stored in separate files rather than all output document templates being stored in the module YAML file.

Other changes:

* A new command-line tool called "assemble" is available that instantiates an entire project from a YAML file of app selections and question answers and generates/saves output documents to files on disk.
* Add system minimum and recommended software requirements to documentation.
* Version 0.8.3 skipped.

Developer changes:

* Non-cryptographic hash functions replace cryptographic hash functions in places where a cryptographic hash function is not necessary and might be excessively slow.
* Other minor fixes.
* Upgraded some dependencies.

v0.8.2 (July 20, 2018)
----------------------

Application changes:

* Javascript and CSS static assets of compliance apps may have had the wrong MIME type set.

App authoring changes:

*  The authoring tool is updated to show app catalog and other app-module YAML in two textareas instead of one, since they are now stored separately in the database (see below), but they are recombined when the authoring tool updates local files.
* A new `version-name` field is added to app.yaml catalog information.

Deployment changes:

* The HTTP Content-Security-Policy header is now set to prevent browsers from loading any third-party assets.
* A CentOS 7-based Vagrantfile has been added to the source distribution for those looking to deploy using a VM.
* Added some outputs to Docker launches to see the Q version and the container user during build and at the very start of container startup.
* We're now publishing version tags to Docker Hub so that past versions of GovReady-Q remain available when we publish a new release.
* With Docker, email environment variable settings were ignored since the last (-rc3) release.

Developer changes:

* The AppInstance table now has created and updated datetime columns, version_number and version_name columns extracted from the catalog metadata, and a new catalog_metadata field that holds the original YAML 'catalog' information (but in JSON in the database; this information was previously in the 'app' Module's spec field).
* The ModuleAssetPack table is dropped and its columns have been moved to the AppInstance table.
* Code refactoring: split module_sources.py into two modules.
* Upgraded some dependencies.
